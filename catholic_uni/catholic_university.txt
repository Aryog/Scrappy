9. Glossary of Terms
1. Background Information
1.1 Australian Catholic University (ACU) is subject to the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 (Act).
The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 which commenced in March 2014
made significant changes to the Act. This Policy complies with the new requirements imposed by the
Act.
2. Policy Statement
2.1 ACU is committed to managing personal information in an open and transparent way. ACU is a
registered company and is subject to the requirements of the Act. It adheres to the Australian
Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.
3. Policy Purpose
3.1 This Policy sets out how ACU collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information including
sensitive information.
4. Application of Policy

4.1 Subject to clause 4.2, this Policy applies to all personal information and sensitive information
collected and held by ACU.
4.2 Despite clause 4.1 , any act done or practice engaged in by ACU directly related to:
a current or former employment relationship between ACU and an individual, and
a current or historical employee record held by ACU relating to an individual
are exempt from this Policy in accordance with the Act and the APPs.
4.3 Employee records are governed by the provisions of ACUâ€™s Employee Records Privacy
Policy.
5. Privacy Principles
5.1 Personal information collected and held by ACU
ACU collects personal information for the purposes of ACUâ€™s functions and activities. It collects
personal information about staff, students and other individuals who have dealings with ACU for
administrative need, to conduct its business, for legislative compliance or for research purposes.
The information may include residence and contact details, date of birth, details of next of kin,
identifying information, including photographs, records of injuries, criminal checks, student
enrolment information and academic performance, qualifications, financial information, information
concerning individuals who apply to the University for appointment or admission, and information
collected from or concerning human research subjects.
Some of the personal information that ACU collects and holds is sensitive information. ACU only
collects sensitive information where it is necessary for the purpose for which it is being collected and
with the individualâ€™s consent unless the collection is required or authorised by law.
5.2 How ACU collects and holds personal information
ACU collects and holds information from a number of sources. Where reasonably possible, ACU will
only collect information from the individual to whom it relates. Frequently this will be collected
through official University administrative processes but it may also be collected from email, letters or
other forms of communication.

ACU also holds personal information about individuals that it generates in the course of its
operational activities, such as recruitment information, student placement information, research
grant applications, academic feedback and examination results and library loan records.
Personal information is held in both paper and electronic form, including databases.
When an individual accesses the ACU website, log files (â€œcookiesâ€•) are created by the web
server that contain certain information including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the visitor, the
previous site visited, the time and date of access and pages visited and downloaded. Cookies allow
a website, such as the ACU website, to temporarily store information on an individualâ€™s machine
for later use. ACUâ€™s website uses cookies to identify unique visitors to the site.
In order to improve ACUâ€™s services and assist the user, ACU may store information about users
of its website to create a digital profile and provide them with information specific to them.
ACU also uses Web Analytics to obtain statistics about how its website is accessed. Web Analytics
relies upon cookies to gather information for the purpose of providing statistical reports to ACU. The
information generated by the cookie about an individualâ€™s use of the ACU website is transmitted
to and stored by Web Analytic service providers on servers located within and outside Australia, but
it does not include any personally identifying information.
Individual users generally have the option of accepting or rejecting cookies by adjusting the settings
in their web browsers. However, rejecting cookies may impact upon the functionality of the ACU
website.
The ACU website may contain links to other websites. ACU cannot control the privacy controls of
third party websites. Third party sites are not subject to ACUâ€™s Privacy Policy or Procedures.
5.3 Notification of collection of personal information
When ACU collects personal information it will advise the individual why it is collecting that
information and how it uses it, whether the collection of the information is required or authorised by
law and the consequences for the individual if the personal information is not collected. It will also
provide information about ACUâ€™s Privacy Policy and about the right of individuals to access and

correct personal information. If ACU collects personal information in circumstances where the
individual may not be aware of the collection it will seek to advise the individual of the collection.
5.4 The purposes for which ACU collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information
ACU collects and uses personal information for a variety of different purposes relating to its
functions and activities including:
enrolling, teaching, examining and graduating its students
enhancing and assessing the student experience and providing a range of services to its staff and
students including library access, health and counselling services, and recreational activities
maintaining contact with its alumni and with other stakeholders in the community
community engagement
Government reporting
commercial application of its intellectual property and professional expertise
undertaking staff and student recruitment activities
undertaking research
handling complaints
conducting its business and improving the way in which it conducts its business
purposes directly related to the above.
5.5 Use or disclosure for secondary purposes
ACU does not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than the purpose for which it
was collected (the primary purpose) unless:
5.5.1 the individual has consented to a secondary use or disclosure, or
5.5.2 the secondary use or disclosure is related to the primary purpose (in the case of personal
information that is not sensitive information) or is directly related to the primary purpose (in the case
of sensitive information), or
5.5.3 it is otherwise required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order,or
5.5.4 a permitted general situation exists (as described in clause 9 of this policy), or

5.5.5 ACU reasonably believes that it is necessary for one or more enforcement related activities
conducted by, or on behalf of,an enforcement body.
In ordinary circumstances, any disclosure of personal information for a secondary purpose under
scenarios 5.5.3, 5.5.4 and 5.5.5 must be approved by the Privacy Officer.
5.6 Security
ACU applies both physical and information and communications technology (ICT) security systems
to protect personal information.
In relation to electronic records, personal information is collected via ACUâ€™s systems including
web-based systems. ACU has put in place measures to protect against loss, misuse and alteration
of electronic information. Where necessary, ACU also uses encryption technology to protect certain
information and transactions.
5.7 Remaining anonymous or using a pseudonym
ACU understands that anonymity is an important aspect of privacy and that in some circumstances
some people may prefer to use a pseudonym when dealing with ACU. People have the right to
remain anonymous or to use a pseudonym when dealing with ACU. However for a significant
proportion of its activities (e.g. matters relating to enrolment, teaching and assessment of individual
students) it is impracticable for ACU to deal with individuals who have not identified themselves or
who have used a pseudonym.
5.8 Unsolicited personal information
When ACU receives unsolicited personal information it will assess whether it is personal information
that it could legally collect. If it is, it will treat it according to the APPs. If it is not, it will, if lawful to do
so, destroy or de-identify it as soon as practicable.
5.9 Direct marketing
ACU will only use personal information for direct marketing with the individualâ€™s consent or when
authorised by law.
5.10 Destruction of information that does not need to be retained

When ACU no longer needs to retain personal information, and is lawfully able to do so, it will
destroy or de-identify that information.
5.11 How an individual may access personal information about the individual that is held by ACU
Subject to clause 4.2, anyone has a right under the Act to access personal information that ACU
holds about them. Access to personal information is governed by the Access to and Correction of
Personal Information Procedure.
5.12 How an individual may seek the correction of personal information about the individual that is
held by ACU
Subject to clause 4.2, anyone has a right under the Act to request corrections to any personal
information that ACU holds about them if they think that the information is inaccurate, out of date,
incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. Correction of personal information is governed by the Access
Procedure.
5.13 How an individual may complain about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles by ACU
Subject to clause 4.2, anyone may complain about a breach of an APP by ACU. Complaints should
be made in accordance with the Privacy Inquiries and Complaints Procedure.
5.14 How ACU will deal with complaints about breaches of the Australian Privacy Principles
ACU will deal with complaints about breaches of the APPs in accordance with the Inquiries and
Complaints Procedure.
5.15 How ACU will manage an actual or suspected data breach under this policy
ACU will manage the process of dealing with an actual or suspected breach in accordance with the
Data Breach Procedure and Response Plan.

Core curriculum
An ACU education is about your integral human development. You are more than your degree.
Itâ€™s learning to look at the world with empathy and confidence. Itâ€™s learning to listen and
lead. Itâ€™s challenging stereotypes, and having the courage to make an impact.
Understanding ourselves and seeing the world through the eyes of others
The universityâ€™s Core Curriculum lies at the heart of this transformation. Itâ€™s a key part of
every ACU studentâ€™s education, giving you time to reflect on what it is to be human, our
common social life and ways we can change the world in important ways.
About the Core Curriculum
In undertaking Core units at ACU, youâ€™ll be in classes with students from other disciplines,
ensuring different viewpoints and lively debate.
Core units can be taken face-to-face, online, or intensively. Thereâ€™s even the chance to
complete a unit (UNCC300) overseas.
The Core is unique to ACU. It will challenge you to see the world from different perspectives and
engage with the world in a meaningful and transformative way.
Core Curriculum structure
The Core Curriculum is comprised of three units:
two coursework units, drawn from either the Catholic social thought (UNCC) or philosophy (PHCC)
streams.

one community engagement unit that is specific to each program, serving to draw the Core
Curriculum experience together and offering students an opportunity to live the Core Curriculum in
action.
These units are fully integrated within your course of study
Community engagement unit: Each faculty at ACU has its own arrangements in place for community
engagement. For details, see your Course Enrolment Guide, and check with your course coordinator
if you have any questions.
Coursework units: You have a choice about which coursework units you select from which stream.
See the course map in your Course Enrolment Guide for details on when you enrol in your Core
Curriculum units.
Choose ONE unit from:
UNCC100: Self and Community: Exploring the Anatomy of Modern Society
PHCC102: Being Human
PHCC104: Ethics and the Good Life
and ONE unit from:
UNCC300: Justice and Change in a Global World
PHCC320: The Just Society
Catholic social thought stream
The two UNCC units (UNCC100 and UNCC300) focus specifically on applying the principles of
Catholic social thought.
These principles include:
the dignity of the human person: every person has value, is worthy of great respect and must be
free from slavery, manipulation and exploitation
solidarity: we are one human family whatever our national, racial, ethnic, economic, and ideological
differences
the common good: everyone should have access to what they need to live a fulfilling life

rights and responsibilities: every person has a fundamental right to those things required for human
decency. Corresponding to these rights are responsibilities, to one another, to our families, and to
the larger society
stewardship of the earth: it is our collective responsibility to care for the world we inhabit.
Catholic Social Thought has informed the development of universal approaches to human rights and
justice in the 20th and 21st centuries. It is closely aligned with the most fundamental principles of
many of the worldâ€™s religions and has influenced the codes of practice for many of our
professions.
Philosophy stream
The three philosophy units (PHCC102, PHCC104, PHCC320) also draw students into thinking about
major issues of relevance to the Catholic tradition of social thought, but they do so by dealing more
basically with questions about what it means to be human, what it means to act well, and what a just
society looks like. This includes things like:
being human: mind and body; reason and emotion; gender and sexuality; personal identity;
individual and community; freedom and limitation; meaning and fulfilment; race and ethnicity; natality
and mortality
the good life: ethics and reason; ethics and feeling; moral absolutes and moral relativity; rules,
consequences and virtues; applying ethical thinking to difficult practical situations
the just society: politics and the good society; wealth distribution and equal opportunity; public ethics
and the law; work and the good life; personal freedom and harming others; taking a global view.
The philosophy units give you the opportunity to engage in reflection and discussion about major
contemporary issues, and training in broad critical thinking skills applicable to a range of
professions.

Course types explained
Understand the different courses we offer so you can make the right choice for your future. Degree
options include undergraduate degrees, and postgraduate degrees by coursework and research.
And not everyone comes to university to study a full degree. You might choose to enrol in a pathway
that will help you prepare for a degree, or you may simply want to study a single unit or short course.

Undergraduate degrees
Youâ€™ll become an undergraduate student when you enrol in and complete your first university
degree. When you graduate, youâ€™ll receive a bachelor degree or associate degree.
While an associate degree is usually completed in two years (full-time), a bachelor degree could
take between three and five years (full-time).
It will take longer to complete your degree if you choose to study part-time. That said, a more flexible
schedule often suits students who are combining study with existing work, raising a family or other
non-university commitments.
View our flexible study options
Elements of an undergraduate degree
Undergraduate degrees involve:
core units (compulsory units for all students of a course)
majors (a series of eight units related to a particular specialist area)
minors (a series of four related units)
elective units (units outside of the scheduled program that a student can choose for themselves)
prerequisites (units that need to be successfully completed before a student can enrol in the next
unit in the sequence).
Some students also choose to complete an honours year after their bachelor degree. This allows
them to study an aspect of their degree in greater depth. Having a specialisation can open up career
opportunities and shows to employers a graduate has developed their critical thinking and research
skills. An honours degree can also provide a pathway to postgraduate study.
When you study an undergraduate degree with us, youâ€™ll graduate with the confidence that our
students get jobs. Weâ€™re ranked top 7 in Australia for undergraduate employment.*

Away From Base
Our Away From Base (AFB) program is a practical option for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
students. AFB combines online learning with intensive residential blocks twice a semester.
Government funding supports travel, accommodation and meal costs for students participating in the
residential block.
Find out more about Away From Base courses
Postgraduate by coursework degrees
If youâ€™ve completed a bachelor degree and want to move onto further study, youâ€™re known
as a postgraduate student.
Postgraduate by coursework programs are ideal for gaining new skills and getting ahead in your
career. Like an undergraduate degree, a postgraduate coursework degree will typically include
classes, set assessment and a number of units youâ€™ll have to complete.
Types of postgraduate by coursework degrees
These course generally run between six months and two years full-time, and there are three levels
of qualification:
graduate certificate
graduate diploma
masters
A graduate certificate may lead into a graduate diploma which, in turn, may lead into a masters.
Students may also use a graduate certificate or graduate diploma as a pathway into the next level of
study.
Explore our postgraduate degrees
Flexible study options
We offer postgraduate coursework degrees in a range of delivery modes, from face-to-face to fully
online, so you can fit study around your other commitments. After all, your degree needs to work for
you.

View our flexible study options
Postgraduate research degrees
If youâ€™ve completed a bachelor degree and want to become a specialist in your field, a higher
degree by research may be for you. These courses give you the opportunity to do extensive
research into a particular topic.
The requirement for entry into a research degree is usually an undergraduate degree. If you want to
enrol in a doctorate program, youâ€™ll also need to have completed an honours year or a masters
degree.
Types of postgraduate research degrees
Under the guidance of an academic supervisor, you can enrol in either a masters by research or a
doctorate. These programs are generally two to four years full-time, though many students take
advantage of our flexible study options.
Before you apply for a research degree itâ€™s a good idea to identify a potential supervisor working
in the field you intend to research. Our supervisors and experts have research experience in a range
of fields and have released publications across all of ACUâ€™s teaching areas.
Learn how to become a research student
Flexible study options
We offer postgraduate research degrees in a range of delivery modes, to allow for the intensive
nature of the research and writing requirements of these programs.
View our flexible study options
Pathway programs
Our admission pathway programs provide an alternative route to university study if you didnâ€™t
get the entry score you need, havenâ€™t completed Year 12 or donâ€™t meet some other
requirement.
Available pathways and entry schemes take previous education and experiences into account,
including:

work and life experience
vocational education and training
sporting or performing prowess
community volunteering.
After you complete a recognised pathway option, such as an associate degree, diploma or
certificate, youâ€™ll be able to gain credit for this study. This makes the transition into your desired
degree a little easier.
Discover your pathway options
Single units
In some cases, you can enrol to study a single unit at ACU, such as a bridging unit or, if you are an
international student, a unit in our intensive July School program.
A bridging unit will help develop your understanding of a particular subject in order for you to meet
the entry requirements of your chosen course.
July School offers international students the opportunity to study an intensive unit for two weeks
during their July vacation. A limited number of July School places are also available for our domestic
students.
View available single units
Language courses
Improve your English skills or add fluency in Italian or Spanish to your skillset with one of our
language programs.
Study English
If you are an international student looking to learn English or improve your English skills, you can
study at the ACU Centre for Languages. We offer a number of different courses based on how
youâ€™ll be using the language.
The centre runs on a five-term schedule so you wonâ€™t have to wait too long for the next start
date.

Learn about our English language courses
Study other languages
If you want to study Spanish or Italian, we offer a Diploma in Languages to help you reach your
goal.
All of our undergraduate students have the opportunity to add this diploma to their course. Other
members of the university and the community can also enrol, and you can take individual language
units that wonâ€™t count towards a formal qualification.
Read about our language courses
Online courses
If youâ€™re looking for a more flexible study option, we offer a range of online courses. Some
courses are delivered fully online but there are also courses that may require a small amount of time
on campus.
For our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, we also offer an Away From Base program.
Students can study online and attend intensive residential blocks twice a semester at a location as
close to home as possible.

Domestic student fees
Your fee amount will depend on your course choice and placement offer. But don't worry: our fees
are transparent, paying is straightforward and we're on hand to help you every step of the way.
What we mean by domestic fees
First, confirm youâ€™re a domestic student
You pay domestic fees if youâ€™re one of the following:
Australian citizen
Australian permanent resident
Australian permanent humanitarian visa holder
New Zealand citizen.
If youâ€™re studying with us on an international visa, youâ€™re considered an international

Visit our international student fees page to learn more
How your fees add up
Your tuition fees will be based on the following factors:
course type (eg undergraduate, postgraduate coursework)
individual unit costs (eg Midwifery Foundations, Painting)
placement offer type (eg domestic fee-paying, Commonwealth supported)
These fees are for tuition only. They donâ€™t include additional expenses such as the Student

Services and Amenities Fee, textbooks, materials and equipment, or living costs.
Before you go places, know your placement
Undergraduate study
If your undergraduate application is successful, weâ€™ll offer you a Commonwealth supported
place (CSP).
In a CSP, the Australian Government subsidises the cost of your course. Youâ€™ll pay the
remainder, known as the student contribution amount.

be changes to the student contribution amounts for commencing and continuing students.
To learn more about these changes and what you may expect to pay, visit Job-ready Graduates
Package.
Postgraduate coursework study
If your postgraduate coursework application is successful, youâ€™ll likely be offered a domestic
fee-paying place (DFP).
Most postgraduate coursework degrees only have DFP places available. We donâ€™t receive any
government funding for these placements.
A small number of postgraduate coursework degrees have Commonwealth supported places
available; however, these are very limited. You can check CSP availability using our course costing
tool â€“ but be aware that it will only show the total number of available places, not how many are
left.

website
How your voice is heard
It's important to us that we consult our students on priorities for SSAF expenditure and its budget,
and to be as transparent as we can.
This is done annually through a student survey, as well as elected student representatives from the
ACU National Student Association and the ACU Postgraduate Association. We welcome feedback
from other student groups too.
Keep an eye out for an announcement for the next student survey in your student email. You can
also reach out to your local student association representative.
Visit our student associations page for contact details
Track how your money is spent
We post recent survey results in the Student Portal for current students to read and provide
feedback.
We also provide cost breakdowns below of how we are investing the SSAF back into our students,
as well as details about funded facilities, services and activities.
Prioritising SSAF funds
Students' top three priorities have been similar over the past few years. In the 2021-22 survey, the
top priorities for SSAF spending were in areas related to:
health and wellbeing
food and drink
employment and career advice
What we can spend the SSAF on
Development
Helping students develop study skills outside their enrolled course
Services
Childcare for children of students

Student legal services
Provision of food and drink to students on campus
Student advocacy for matters arising under ACU's rules
Non-academic libraries and reading rooms

Orientation information
Matters arising under ACU's rules
International student support including welfare, accommodation and employment
Annual budgets
We propose a budget for the year ahead based on your feedback regarding the SSAF.
SSAF is spent on new and improved student services, activities, and facilities in the following
categories:
Student Participation: Student associations and clubs and societies on campus, including the ACU
National Student Association (ACUNSA), the Campus Student Association, and the Postgraduate
Association (ACUPGA). ACUNSA and ACUPGA are formally consulted on the SSAF budget. Other

leadership groups on campus are also supported by SSAF separately under Health, Sport and
Wellbeing, and Social and Cultural Activities.
Student Services: Significant student programs and their staffing, including the Careers and
Employability, Student Jobs on Campus, Student Advocacy, and student legal service. This also
includes services such as the ACU App, residential advisory service and medical services on some
campuses.
Social and Cultural Activities: A range of student programs and events which enhance student life
on campus such as oratory, drama, art, photography, choir, language classes, recreational reading
and movies from the library, orientation activities across all campuses and online.
Sporting Programs: Social and community sporting activities, sport clubs, gyms, major university
sporting events, and the Elite Athlete and Performer Program.

read these thoroughly before you apply.
Criteria could include:
Course type
Campus location

Citizenship or family background

Financing your studies
Education is invaluable but paying up front isnâ€™t always possible. Itâ€™s important to know
there are many ways to fund your ACU studies, including government assistance, scholarships and
income support.
How you can fund your studies
If youâ€™re not able to pay right away, you may be able to defer your tuition costs, receive income
support or get some help with your bills.
Three different types of financial assistance are available for domestic and international students:
Fee assistance: These are loans and schemes that only cover your cost of tuition. They do not
include materials and equipment costs.
Outside of fee assistance: These provide financial support to supplement your income, pay for
materials and equipment, or help with transport or living costs.
Scholarships: Our scholarships reward students who have excelled in some way or provide support
to students who are facing hardships.
Scholarships
We offer a wide range of scholarships which provide financial assistance for eligible students.
Scholarships are always worth looking into; you might be eligible for more than you think.
Browse our scholarships
You may also be eligible to apply for external scholarships offered by organisations not affiliated
with ACU. Enquiries and applications are made directly to the external organisations. Visit External
Scholarships for more information.

course page.

can do so at your relevant TAC website.

including professional qualifications if you have any. This canâ€™t be a downloaded transcript from
a website.

name change (eg, a marriage certificate).

If you are applying for a postgraduate nursing program, you must provide a copy of your current
nursing registration certificate.
Check if your course has additional requirements
Some of our postgraduate courses have additional requirements, such as forms to fill out or tests to
take.
You can find links to these requirements listed below:

What are individual units?
Subject to approval and availability, you can study up to two units in any study period at ACU. These
single unit or subjects are delivered on a fee-paying, non-award basis, meaning they will not count
towards a formal award such as a certificate, diploma or bachelors degree. To study an individual
unit, you must meet the unit requirements. You will also be formally assessed in your enrolled
unit(s).
How to find an individual unit
To find the individual unit you wish to study, you can browse a full listing of unit descriptions or
search for a course that interests you. Course listings also include a sample course map with unit
descriptions.
Please note: Not all units are available at all campuses or available for study as individual units.

Accreditation toward a course
If you subsequently apply for, and are granted, admission to a course at ACU, any individual units
you undertook and successfully completed on a non-award basis may be credited to that course.

Accreditation is subject to the Academic Regulations and the relevant course rules.
Read our latest academic regulations
Units with a practical component
You will not be offered a place in a unit that includes a practical placement or professional
experience, except with the approval of the Executive Dean. This applies to individual units studied
on a non-award, cross-institutional, or auditing basis.
Apply for an individual unit
For more information about individual units, including campus availability and applying for
admission, visit the undergraduate and postgraduate unit pages in our course browser.

I have completed military service
You stood for your country, now we stand for you.
Weâ€™re here to help support your studies. If you are a current or former member of the Australian
Defence Force, you might be eligible for ACUâ€™s Veteransâ€™ Entry Program (VEP) and Student
Veterans Support Program (SVSP).
Register for the Veteran Entry Program
Empowering veteran success
Transitioning out of the military can be difficult for many veterans, with high rates of unemployment
and mental health issues. Higher education is an internationally established pathway to assist
veterans in successfully transitioning from the military to civilian life, broadening personal networks,
and creating a pathway to gainful employment. We assess applicants on a case by case basis, and
once youâ€™re an ACU student, the Student Veteran Support Program will help smooth the

transition to student life.
Am I eligible for the VEP?
We encourage individuals from all branches of military service to apply for the Veteransâ€™ Entry
Program. If youâ€™re unsure about whether you will qualify, we still encourage you to apply.
If you want to study at ACU, and you have served in one of the Australian Defence Force, you can
apply via the link below. Weâ€™ll assess your service in the military and convert this to an entry
rank, similar to an ATAR. We then match that rank to the requirements of the undergraduate or
postgraduate course you wish to study and make you an offer based on the outcome.
As a guide, completion of general training in the Australian Defence Force with two yearsâ€™
experience (regardless of military rank held) will result in a rank of 82, which would gain entry into
most ACU Bachelor degrees. We will provide individualised assessment of experience and
qualifications to determine the highest entry rank available to you.
If youâ€™re applying to ACU via the relevant TAC (UAC, VTAC or QTAC), you are also eligible to
receive a rank based on your service in the ADF, and this will be done automatically.
Gain credit for one unit
In recognition of your service to country and community, ACU will grant you credit for the Core
Curriculum unit, Justice and Change in a Global World. This credit is available for most
undergraduate degrees.
Leadership experience counts
Becoming an officer or senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO) in the ADF shows leadership and
management capability. We recognise the life and work skills required to achieve this rank, so
weâ€™re offering unconditional entry to two of our postgraduate courses.
If you have attained the equivalent rank of O-1 or above as an officer or chaplain, or E06 and above
as a SNCO, you are eligible for direct entry into the Graduate Certificate in Business Administration
or Graduate Certificate in Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental Management.
Applications to study in Semester 2 2023 will close on 16 July 2023.

See full course details
Are you a partner, spouse, or child of a Veteran? You may be eligible
Finding meaningful employment is important to all Australians. Often for the family members of ADF
personnel there can be significant barriers when pursuing educational/employment goals due to
service commitments such as posting cycles, deployments and/or locality. This pathway aims to
provide recognition of these challenges and sacrifices by giving the opportunity to access a range of
study options, increasing employability and opening the door to meaningful employment.
This entry pathway is available to any partner, spouse, or child over the age of 18 of
current/previous serving ADF personnel. Applications are handled on a case-by-case basis though
as a rule of thumb 2-years of service is required. If you are unsure of your eligibility, we encourage
you to contact one of our Student Veteran Services team to discuss further.
Applications can be made directly to ACU through the Veterans Entry Program web form. Applicants
will be required to submit a copy of their partner, spouses or parents ADF Service Record. Following
application, you will be contacted to schedule an interview date and requested for supporting
documentation including a written â€˜motivation to studyâ€™ form.
Apply for 2023 intake
Use this link to register your interest for a course at ACU, starting in 2023.
Youâ€™ll need to share your name and contact details, as well as your ADF service statement and
educational history. Donâ€™t forget to tell us which course/s you are interested in. We will then
contact you to provide personalised assistance with applying to study at ACU. Applications through
the Veterans Entry Program will be automatically registered to the Student Veterans Support
Program.
Applications to study with ACU Online's Term 3 (commencing 17 July 2023) close 3 July and Term
4 (commencing 9 October 2023) close 25 Sept 2023. Applications for Semester 2 2023
(commencing 31 July) close 16 July.

Recognition of Prior Learning
As a member of the ADF you undergo rigorous training and gain valuable work experience. ACU
recognises this and provides the opportunity to receive credit for your service.
Credit where credits due
The Australian Catholic University (ACU) recognises the challenges involved in transitioning from
the ADF into tertiary education.
To help you with this transition we are the first Australian university to formally recognise the
courses you have completed during your ADF service.
You no longer need to pay a third-party training organisation to provide you with â€˜on-paperâ€™
diplomas.
Learn more
What is RPL?
Recognition of Prior Learning is a formal process of reviewing previously undertaken study or work
experience. If this study or work experience is similar to ACU units then you may be eligible for
credit towards your course.
RPL can reduce the amount of time it takes to finish your degree, and also make your degree more
cost effective.
The courses you undertook whilst you were serving in the ADF are considered formal learning by
ACU.
How much RPL can I receive?
ACU has a tailored approach towards RPL for Student Veterans. We conducted an assessment the

Initial Employment Training (IET) courses and promotion courses delivered by the ADF.
The amount of credit available is dependent on the duration of your IET and the rank you achieved
during your service. We understand that there can be individual variations in a Student
Veteranâ€™s service record, so we assess each one individually.
Your Course Rules will also influence how much RPL you are eligible for.
As a Student Veteran you can always apply for RPL, your Course Coordinator will assess your
application for specified or unspecified credit.
RPL for Other Ranks
There are 4 packages based upon:
Rank and IET course
ACUâ€™s Course Rules.
Anyone who is Private Proficient, or the equivalents in the RAN & RAAF, can access package 1.
RPL for Officers
Officers will be eligible for 40 points of credit towards the ACU MBA if you have completed:
Stream 1 and your rank is Lieutenant or above
Stream 2 and your rank is Captain or above
Apply for 2023 intake
Use this link to register your interest for a course at ACU, starting in 2023.

educational history. Donâ€™t forget to tell us which course/s you are interested in.

Get the credit you deserve. Save time and money by checking if your previous work experience or
study can be credited towards your ACU degree.

Course or campus transfers
How to apply
What we mean by recognition of prior learning and credit
If you have already studied at university level or have significant relevant work experience, you
might be eligible to have your prior learning recognised.
Prior learning may include:
formal learning undertaken at an accredited education provider that leads towards a formal
qualification
non-formal learning that takes place through a structured program but does not lead to an officially
accredited qualification
informal learning gained through work, social, family, hobby or leisure activities.
Recognition of prior learning (RPL)
Recognition of prior learning (RPL) is the assessment process for matching an applicantâ€™s skills,
knowledge and/or experiences to specific requirements.
These requirements can include:
admission requirements
professional requirements
unit learning/competency outcomes

course learning/competency outcomes.
Credit
Prior learning can be taken into account when you are applying for a place in a course. Or, you
might be able to apply for credit towards your current ACU degree (sometimes known as advanced
standing). Credited units replace units you would otherwise study, so you can finish your course
sooner.
You can use our credit search to see what credit you might be eligible for.
Search our credit database
How to apply
Once you have accepted your offer and enrolled, you can apply for credit by submitting our
application form with your supporting documents.

conditions at the time that you begin your studies.
Postgraduate courses that have an interview component to the selection process may need you to
re-interview at the point of commencing studies.
Postgraduate courses that offer specialisations may not be able to guarantee that your preferred
specialisation will be on offer when you begin your studies.
Commonwealth Supported Places within postgraduate courses are not available for deferment.
Students who are studying as a part of a sponsored-cohort will need to check with their sponsoring
body for approval to defer.

more than two years (four or more standard study periods), you might need to complete additional
units or assessments to make sure that your knowledge in the field is up-to-date.

be any employerâ€™s first choice, ready to contribute and shape the worldâ€™s new tomorrow.
AGILEâ€™s mission

As members of AGILE we see that the commitment of global impact precedes the demand for
leadership to fulfill what's wanted and needed in the world. AGILE attracts and selects those who
are already leaders with the intention to elevate their leadership, power, productivity and therefore
impact and will be developed in quick, flexible, and agile leadership.
About the program
AGILE is exclusive to first year students who have a predicted ATAR of 90+ and students with a
GPA of 5.75. AGILE members will have access to a range of personal and career enhancing
opportunities including:
Virtual lunch with ACUâ€™s senior executive
This is an opportunity for AGILE members to meet the senior executive of ACU, including the
Provost, and hear about their vision for ACU. AGILE members will have the opportunity to ask
questions and get advice about their academic and professional trajectory, as well as meet other
local AGILE members to establish support networks. The Lunch with Leaders presentation will be
virtual; however you will be invited to attend your local campus to meet members in person, listen to
the presentation, and then come together for lunch afterwards.
Leadership in Action
Leadership in Action is an opportunity provided to AGILE members enrolled in community
engagement units in semester two. You will be mentored by the external organisation We Aspire to
elevate your leadership by developing and creating your own project that has an impact on the
communities you care about. In 2022, students developed projects such as sports clubs for low
socio economic schools, tutoring sessions to address mental health in young people, empowering
Muslim women leadership, nappy drives for mothers living in poverty and many more.
GIVE (Global Impact of Value and Excellence) Talks
GIVE Talks are exclusive to AGILE members and ACU staff, and will celebrate excellence in
leadership that makes a positive impact on local and global communities. By sharing in the
speakersâ€™ journeys you will become empowered to begin shaping and creating change and

encouraged to reconsider your predetermined notions of what leadership is. The GIVE Talks will
draw on the expertise of ACU, Australian, and global leaders.
Leadership Incubator
The Leadership Incubator is exclusive to AGILE members and itâ€™s an opportunity to take part in
paid internships and professional development within ACU and with external organisations. AGILE

Support for Year 12 students
While Year 12 is a challenge at the best of times, finishing school in the midst of a global pandemic
is tough. So, weâ€™ve been looking at a range of ways to help and support you during your final
year of schooling â€“ from exam support to university admission. Weâ€™re hoping these programs
and activities will help you gain confidence as you approach exams, and provide some certainty

around university entry in a deeply uncertain time.
Study at ACU Webinars
Join us online to have all your questions about studying at ACU answered. Get helpful advice on
how to apply, find out more about pathways to uni, explore your study options and hear from ACU
students about what life is really like at ACU. Study at ACU Webinars are held regularly and you can
register for one or all webinars.
Campus tours
Explore your campus and discuss your study options by booking a guided campus tour.
Due to current public health restrictions by some state governments, our group campus tours have
been temporarily suspended for some of our campuses but will be up and running once restrictions
ease. For now, you can explore our campuses with our 360-degree virtual tours.
Adjustment factors and access schemes
We offer a range of entry assistance programs, including special access schemes for each state,
and our adjustment factor programs like the School Relationship Program, Campus Program,
Subject Program and Regional Schools Program. Each adjustment factor program will automatically
grant eligible students up to five adjustment factors (eligible for a maximum of 12 adjustment factors
across all programs).
Please note that a different process applies to applications for the ACU Guarantee program where
you may receive a maximum of 10 adjustment factors.

Semester programs
Language select
English
Choose to study with us for one or two semesters and you'll be fully immersed in the Australian way
of life. With study options that include a community engagement placement, you'll gain new friends,
new skills and new experiences.
Weâ€™re ready for you to make your move
Our semester long programs attract students from all over the world to learn and engage at our six
Australian campuses.
Whether youâ€™re on exchange from your home university or just looking for an amazing overseas
learning experience, youâ€™ll have access to the same courses and units.
Study Abroad or Exchange?
While our core academic program is similar for study abroad and exchange students, you should
first understand which program you will be undertaking abroad:
Exchange: Open to students who are enrolled and nominated by an official exchange partner of
ACU. Exchange students pay tuition fees only to their home university (ACU tuition fees do not
apply).

Study Abroad: Open to students who are enrolled and nominated by an official Study abroad partner
of ACU, as well as applicants who apply direct to ACU from a recognised university or college.
Students are subject to ACU study abroad tuition fees per semester.
Academic Program
The Study Abroad and Exchange program at ACU is flexible, allowing you to enrol in units from
different areas of study, enhancing your academic experience even more. Whether they are core
classes or electives, you can select whatâ€™s right for you. All Study Abroad and Exchange
students must be enrolled as a fulltime student for the length of their program.
Location: Sydney, Brisbane, Ballarat, Melbourne, Canberra
Duration: 1 or 2 semesters
When: February and July intakes
Study Load: 30 or 40 credit points per semester.
Virtual Study Abroad and Exchange
We understand that international travel interruptions or home country commitments can prevent you
from undertaking a study program in Australia. However, that does not limit your ability to undertake
an Australian study experience. ACU offers the opportunity to enrol in a virtual academic program of
10 to 40 credit points from your current country of residence. Enrolling in online studies at ACU is a
valuable way to complement, rather than replace, your ongoing studies at home.
Our online units are delivered using a range of online learning systems and you can maintain access
to ACU study support services for the duration of your program. You can view a list of virtual units
on our semester program units page.
Choose your subjects
When you study with us, you can select classes from any of our four faculties in areas including
education, arts, health sciences, law, business, theology and philosophy.
View our study abroad and exchange subjects
Community Engagement Program

Learn how to make a meaningful impact on the community and put your new skills into practice by
combining your learning abroad study with community volunteering. Youâ€™ll enrol in one of our
academic units that facilitates your participation in a community engagement opportunity. And
youâ€™ll go beyond the Australian tourist sights to develop a deeper understanding of our society,
gain real-world experience, and consider ethical perspectives in your decision making.
Location: Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne
When: February and July intake
Unit value: 10 credit points. This unit will be included in the full-time study load during the semester
Credit: The academic unit will appear on your official academic transcript. Some units may only
display an overall result of Pass Ungraded (PS) or Fail Ungraded (NU).

Academic
Our residents have proven that they achieve higher academic pass rates than other students. We
believe this is partly due to our tailored academic offerings from our residential life program, which is
available to all residents.
Social
Our community is inclusive, supportive and welcoming which really helps to complement our
residentsâ€™ success during their time living in student accommodation. We encourage
opportunities for students to be â€˜life-readyâ€™ and to gain skills that will assist them beyond their
time in residence.
Cultural and community
We continually look for opportunities to help our residents become immersed in their community.
Community engagement and cultural awareness are key elements to producing graduates that are
in tune with the world around them.
Health and wellbeing
There is a strong link between good overall health and cognitive function so we believe keeping our
students active and engaged with their wellbeing is important to their success with their studies.
Spiritual
Having an awareness of your personal spiritual belief system can help you be a well-rounded
resident. We encourage all our residents to express their spiritual beliefs by creating a respectful
and engaged environment.

Applying for your student visa
Language select
English
If you are an international student accepted into a course at ACU, you may need a student visa to
study in Australia. It is important to understand the process of applying for your student visa. Read
our guide below.
Do I need a student visa?
Most international students studying in Australia require a student visa. For courses that last for 3
months or less, you do not require a student visa and the University will not issue you with a
Confirmation of Enrolment.
Find out more about visa eligibility from the Department of Home Affairs
How to apply for a student visa
Once you have accepted your offer, we will issue you with a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE). You
will need your CoE to apply for a student visa.
You must apply for your visa through the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). Depending on your
citizenship and location, you may be eligible to apply online.
Apply for your visa on the DHA website
Many students use the services of an education agent to process their visa application.
Find an ACU education agent in your country

DHA must be satisfied that you can meet certain requirements to study in Australia, and that you are
a Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE), before granting you a student visa. To be recognised as a
GTE, academic study must be your primary purpose for coming to Australia.
Read more about genuine temporary entrants on the DHA website
Visa conditions
Student visas are normally granted for the duration of your course of study. The following conditions
apply:
As an international student, you must complete your course within the minimum course duration
listed on your CoE.
ACU must report any ELICOS student who does not attend classes or who is not making
satisfactory progress as defined in the Universityâ€™s academic regulations.
It is your responsibility to be aware of and comply with the conditions of your student visa.
Read the full list of visa conditions on the DHA website
Arranging visas for family (dependents)
If you intend to bring family members with you to Australia, they will be required to travel on a lawful
visa.
While you are in Australia, you will be responsible for supporting any dependents (family members).
You must pay tuition fees for school-age dependents who study in Australia.
Learn more about applying for visas for family members on the DHA website
Staying for graduation and beyond
If you wish to stay in Australia for your graduation ceremony, you may need to apply for a
Visitor-class visa.
Apply for a Visitor visa on the DHA website
You can also consider applying for a Temporary Graduate visa, which will allow you to live and work
in Australia temporarily following your studies.
Apply for a Temporary Graduate visa on the DHA website

Extend your student visa
International students on a student visa must complete their course within the duration of their CoE.
It may, however, be possible to extend your visa.
Find out more
Change your education provider
If you have not completed the first six months of your principal course at ACU, you must seek
approval from us if you wish to enrol with another education provider.
Read more about release for international students on a student visa
Permanent residency
If you are granted permanent resident status while you are studying in Australia, you must advise
the University. You can do this by completing and submitting the Notification of Permanent
Residency (PR) Status form on Student Portal.
To be eligible to pay domestic student fees, you must submit the PR form before the census date for
your current semester of study.
If you submit the PR form after the census date, you will remain liable for international student fees
for the remainder of that study period. You will be eligible to pay domestic fees at the beginning of
the following semester.

â€œI chose to study at ACU because of the small class sizes, campus location, employment rates
and embedded pro bono experience. The friendly and welcoming atmosphere at Open Day was
also extremely encouraging.â€•

Student stories
Ever wondered where other students came from? Or where theyâ€™re going? Perhaps youâ€™re
curious about what inspired them to study a course here, with us, and how they went on to do great
things? Here are their stories.
Read their stories, write your own
We're proud to attract students from many backgrounds and experiences, brought together with the
common goal of making real, lasting impact through empathy.
Our students are a diverse group. They come from all around Australia, and from all around the
world.
What connects them?
Every single one of our students has their own reason for studying with us, and their own story to
tell.

What they do have in common is a desire to make a positive impact through their study and career
choices.
Who do you want to be?
If you like the sound of that, we encourage you to read their stories and be inspired, before you write
your own.
Chris Moloney, Bachelor of Education
Chris was the first person in his family to leave the farm and follow a path to university. What he
discovered was that sometimes things donâ€™t always go to plan â€“ and thatâ€™s not necessarily
a bad thing.
â€œThe thing I enjoy most about the physiotherapy course at ACU is the huge practical component
thatâ€™s intertwined into every class and subject. This hands-on experience has really prepared
me for employment after university.
â€œAs a physiotherapist, I hope to help patients of all ages maintain good health, relieve pain,
restore muscle function, and manage their condition so they can achieve their goals and receive
long-term health benefits.â€•
Hannah Ragell
Bachelor of Physiotherapy
Alasdair McIntyre, PhD in Visual Arts
After completing his honours degree at ACU, Alasdair chose to further his study with us. Hereâ€™s
how he found the support he needed to make a name for himself in the art world.
â€œAs a postgraduate student, Iâ€™ve really enjoyed getting back into that learning frame of mind
again. My course has a small number of students so weâ€™ve been able to connect really well with
each other and with our lecturers and tutors.
â€œOne of the best things about studying again is the confirmation that, yes, I have learned a thing
or two since I was a new grad! Also, the networking opportunities and getting to know the experts in
our fields and my colleagues across the country has been a great experience.â€•

Jessica Dennis
Master of Rehabilitation (Neuro Physiology)
â€œI am in my third year studying a Bachelor of Business Administration. I wanted to be part of an
institution that gave back to the community. For me, ACU has brought me close to the community
and the people.
â€œUniversity has been an adventurous journey for me. I have met many people and made
awesome friends. Being part of the student association (MAKSA), I have met people from all walks
of life. I have learned many skills and gained experiences that I will continue to use in the future.â€•

Sports, health and wellbeing facilities
A balanced lifestyle means you can focus on study â€“ and remain well when you put the books
down for a break. At each of our campuses, youâ€™ll have ample opportunity to shake off a heavy
class or study session, and talk through any concerns. For us, itâ€™s about you.
Reach out and recharge
Exercise your body after giving your brain a workout and youâ€™ll feel the benefits. But physical

activity isnâ€™t the only way to look after your health and wellbeing. We look after your whole
person.
If you need to talk with someone in order to stay well, you can always book an appointment with a
counsellor, chat with one of the campus ministry team or drop into a medical centre at our campuses
in Brisbane or Melbourne.
And, if you do want to stretch those muscles and add some physical activity to your day, there are
swimming pools at our Brisbane and Canberra campuses, and gyms at Brisbane, Melbourne and
North Sydney. We run fitness classes on every campus, too, and you can take part in the
jam-packed weekly event calendar of The Track on our Melbourne, North Sydney and Strathfield
Campuses.
Community facilities
Our gyms are open to the local community, so you donâ€™t have to be a student to join.

Access and Disability Service
ACU has a dedicated team whose primary focus is to establish support for students with a

temporary or ongoing medical/mental health condition, disability or significant carer responsibilities.
The Access and Disability Service works with the student to establish reasonable adjustments (such
as extensions and exam adjustments), explore learning support services, and assist with physical
access arrangements.
Here, when you need us
Students will have the opportunity to disclose whether they have a medical/mental health condition,
disability or significant carer responsibilities on their enrolment form. This disclosure is not a
registration with the Access and Disability Service. If a student discloses on enrolment, an
introductory email from the Access and Disability Service will be sent inviting them to register for
support.
Once enrolment has been completed, students can register with our service. Whilst it is
recommended that they do so as soon as practical to ensure timely access to adjustments, students
can register at any stage during their studies.
What legislation informs the practice of the Access and Disability Service?
The following legislation informs the practice of the Disability Service:
Disability Discrimination Act 1992
Disability Standards for Education 2005
Carer Recognition Act 2010
The definition of â€˜disabilityâ€™ provided within the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 is broad.
Disability can be permanent, intermittent, temporary, visible and/or invisible in nature.
Disability can include, but is not limited to:
Medical conditions
Mental health conditions
Learning disorder
Neurodiversity
Physical disability

Vision and hearing conditions
Temporary injury and/or condition

Students with significant caring responsibilities can access our services. According to the Carer
Recognition Act 2010, a carer is someone who provides significant care for an individual who has an
ongoing health condition, disability or is elderly.
The Access and Disability Service require appropriate supporting documentation, with evidence of a
diagnosis (or under investigation for a diagnosis) and its impact on your studies to develop an
Education Inclusion Plan (EIP). This is done to ensure we take into consideration the most accurate
information about your condition(s), aiding us to establish reasonable adjustments with you.
If you are unsure of whether your individual circumstances meet the above definition, please book
an appointment with an Access and Disability Advisor to discuss further.
How does ACU communicate reasonable adjustments?
ACU provides adjustments through a document known as the Education Inclusion Plan (EIP). The
EIP is collaboratively developed with the student to optimise their participation during their time with
ACU and to communicate their learning needs with relevant staff.
All students will be required to provide their preferences regarding confidentiality. In most
circumstances, the EIP will not disclose a student's condition. The documentâ€™s focus is to outline
the reasonable adjustments that will enable students to participate in the learning environment on
the same basis as other students.
How do I register?
To register with the Access and Disability Service, students need to have completed all aspects of
their enrolment and provide evidence from an appropriately qualified health practitioner confirming
the diagnosis and impacts of the mental health/health condition(s), disability, neurodiversity and/or
significant carer responsibilities. Medical evidence will need to meet the guidelines found within the
Supporting Documentation Form.

To assist in seeking medical evidence:
The Supporting Documentation Form (60KB) can be completed for a health condition/disability
relating to the student (Note: Learning disabilities require an appropriate learning assessment)
The Carer Supporting Documentation Form (128KB) can be completed by the health practitioner
treating the person receiving care.
For more information on registration and for resources regarding disability support, please visit our
Access and Disability Service student portal page.
Course inherent requirements
ACU endeavours to identify Inherent Requirements for all ACU courses to assist individuals to make
informed choices. Inherent requirements are the essential components of a course or unit that
demonstrate the capabilities, knowledge and skills to achieve the core learning outcomes of the
course or unit. Students with a health condition/disability may be able to have reasonable
adjustments made to enable them to meet these requirements.
Getting to, from and around campus
Campus maps provide transport options for getting to and from campus, including the shuttle service
at Brisbane and Strathfield campuses.
Within these maps, students will also find information on accessibility relevant to each campus.
Disability parking is available for those who hold a valid permit. Facilities manage parking in
accordance with the Car Parking Policy.
Information for parents/significant others
We understand that this may be an individual's first opportunity to engage in an adult learning
environment, and parents may wish to understand university systems or options for support. Whilst
we cannot provide specific information relating to a student, we can assist parents in understanding
available options.
With the studentâ€™s consent, significant others can attend appointments with the student.

Student associations
About our student associations
Our student associations are the lifeblood of ACU Student Life. They are run for students, by
students and ensure that your voice is heard at the highest levels of the university.
There are three types of student association at ACU:
ACU National Student Association (ACUNSA)
ACU Postgraduate Student Association (ACUPGA)
local campus associations.
Each of these groups has a particular role in supporting and representing our student bodies.
These groups also have one thing in common: they all rely on students getting involved and working
to make the ACU experience great for everyone.
Getting involved with a student association will help you develop leadership skills, build important
networks and bring people together.

Clubs and societies
University isnâ€™t simply about hitting the books; itâ€™s also about meeting new people and
getting involved in student life. There are plenty of student-run clubs and societies at each of our
campuses. Sign up to meet students from across the faculties, build networks and develop new
skills.
Join a club or start your own
Students have started a number of cultural clubs, faculty clubs and faith clubs on each of our
campuses, so there are plenty to join. Examples of clubs started by students include the Strathfield
Drama Society, the Melbourne Midwifery Society and the North Sydney Social Justice Society.

But, if there isnâ€™t currently a club that caters to your interests, why not get a group of students
together and start your own?
How to start a club
To start a club or society, get in touch with the Student Life team with information about your club. A
Student Life Officer will get in touch to discuss the next step in the process.

ACU Active
ACU Active brings together the fitness facilities you need with the expert guidance you deserve. Our
boutique health clubs provide a welcoming space to pursue your fitness goals with up-to-date,

evidence-based advice from exercise science qualified professionals. With affordable fortnightly
memberships including unlimited access to our gyms, wellness programming, group training and
online and outdoor fitness, ACU Active is here to help you get active, stay active and love being
active.
Why ACU Active
At ACU Active, our mission is simple: to help students, staff and local community get active, stay
active and love being active. Itâ€™s no small task, but we think weâ€™re up to the job. Why?
Because we know a long-term, sustainable commitment to health and wellbeing takes more than
just sweat and determination alone. Thatâ€™s why our programs and facilities will activate your
body, refresh your mind, keep you connected when life gets hectic and provide you with the
knowledge you need to reach your fitness goals.
Active in connection
Stay on track and connected even when you canâ€™t make it to the gym, with exclusive access to
our online classes, seminars and pop-up outdoor sessions. Itâ€™s just one of the many ways
weâ€™ll help you keep moving forward when lifeâ€™s little challenges threaten to get in the way of
your health and wellness goals.
Active in mind
Our holistic approach to wellbeing is captured in our â€œvibe wellnessâ€• classes. Delivered both in
person and online, we have a range of yoga, Pilates and meditation/mindfulness sessions facilitated
by professional teachers. We strongly believe these programs are an important (and often
overlooked) opportunity to destress and refresh your mind.
Active in body
Our fully equipped modern gyms and â€˜The Zoneâ€™ high intensity group training sessions offer
everything you need to improve your fitness, strength, and physical wellbeing.
From free weights, machines, cardio equipment and functional training gear, your body will thank
you for the wide variety of training options. Weâ€™ve got you covered!

Active in knowledge
Get the guidance you deserve for no-extra cost with our Kick Starter program. Weâ€™ll design your
training program and provide ongoing support to make sure youâ€™re on the path to reaching your
goals. Our exercise science qualified professionals will make sure you receive up-to-date,
evidence-based knowledge and advice.

Melbourne is Australiaâ€™s cultural heart. With world-class music and theatre events, museums
and galleries, there is always something to see and do.
The city itself is a mix of Victorian-era architecture and modern buildings with famous laneways that
hide bars, restaurants and cafes. For outdoor lovers there are many gardens and parks to explore,
the Yarra River, the famous St Kilda beach and a good network of bike paths to get around.
Itâ€™s easy to see why Melbourne has also been voted as one of the world's most liveable cities.

The Gaudete Centre, Brisbane
The Gaudete Centre is located on the top floor of the Mercy Building. One of The Gaudete
Centreâ€™s most impressive features is a balcony that provides a breakout space for guests to
enjoy the 270-degree views of Moreton Island and the bay, the airport, the Port of Brisbane, the city

skyline, Mt Coot-tha and the D'aguilar Range. It was modelled somewhat as an "Oculus", being an
outward-looking "eye across the region.

About the venue
The state-of-the-art function centre can be configured in multiple formats to accommodate formal
meetings and external events such as conferences, award ceremonies, lectures, formal sit-down
lunches/dinners and cocktail functions.
The term â€˜gaudeteâ€™ comes from the Latin verb gaudere, meaning â€˜you all rejoiceâ€™. The
notion of rejoicing has been central to the theology of His Holiness, Pope Francis, alongside the
concept of mercy, for which the Mercy Building itself is named. The Gaudete Centre is a place that
rejoices in gifts and celebrates the concrete particularity of each person and an embodiment of that
unfolding possibility that is the true purpose of an education within a Catholic university.
The Gaudete Centre is managed by The Office of the Vice-Chancellor and President and is
available for internal and external bookings.

Long-term vision the key for teacher shortfall
The national discussion around the shortage of teachers provides a rich opportunity to find solutions
to problems that are years in the making.
Bridging the gender gap in sports science research
In August 2022, when world-class runner Dina Asher-Smith spectacularly slowed down halfway into
the womenâ€™s 100-metre final at the European Championships, she revealed that cramps related
to her period caused her to stop running. She went on to highlight the fact that menstrual cycles
have a huge impact on the performance of female athletes, and yet, very little research has been
conducted to examine its influence.
How historical research benefits communities in the here and now
There is a popular aphorism, one that is often attributed to the British statesman Winston Churchill
but which was likely first coined by Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, that declares:
â€œThose who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.â€•

Research and Enterprise Plan 2022â€“2023
Nurturing the research ecosystem
The priority of ACUâ€™s research intensification strategy, commenced in 2013, was to develop the
universityâ€™s standing within the academy. ACUâ€™s significant rise in world rankings attests to
the success of this strategy. The next stage of development for research at ACU is to expand
beyond our current focus on a single component of research-related activity â€“ knowledge creation
â€“ to nurture all components of the research ecosystem. In line with the current ACU Strategic Plan
2020-2023, the priority of the Research and Enterprise Plan 2022-2023 is to achieve sustainable
excellence in the development of future research capability, effective infrastructure and systems,
fundamental research, the translation of research, and the application of research.
Research and Enterprise Plan 2022-2023 (PDF, 1MB)
Knowledge creation
World-leading fundamental research in focus areas addressing key issues and challenges, involving
strategic global academic collaborations with leading research institutions, and partnerships with
stakeholders.

Translation and impact
Real-world impact and outcomes from research translation, demonstrating tangible local, national
and international social, cultural and economic benefits.
Partnerships
Connected and mutually enriching strategic national and international partnerships: build on existing
partnerships with Catholic stakeholders in research and education-related activities, and develop
new collaborations with industry, government and the wider community.
Culture and environment
A public-facing, engaged and vibrant academic community and a research-informed curriculum with
structures and systems that inspire and drive excellence, support entrepreneurial initiatives and
multidisciplinary exploration of global issues and challenges, and provide mentoring and leadership
in research.
Capability and capacity
World-leading researchers driving excellence, developing and empowering future generations â€“
with a particular focus on Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students and Early Career
Researchers (ECR) â€“ and increasing pathways and opportunities to ensure ACU develops
world-ready graduate researchers.

Research Centre for Digital Data and Assessment in Education
Title of slideshow
Our research examines digital disruption, assessment and data analytics as subjects of research,
policy and practice in schooling reform and teacher education. Drawing on international, national,
and state-based partnerships, the centre addresses a global knowledge gap in how new and
emerging technologies are transforming the practices and experience of education inside and
outside schooling.
Our research
The centre has three research programs:
Data and Digital Practices at System and School Level led by Professor Bob Lingard
Data Innovation for Learning Progression and Life Course in Teacher Education led by Professor
Michele Haynes
Digital Foundations in the Early Years led by Professor Susan Edwards.
Program one â€“ Data and Digital Practices at System and School Level
This program examines digital disruption in schooling. It will focus on the digitalisation and
expansion of large-scale standardised assessments (both international and national) and their
usage and effects in systems and schools. It also focuses on the necessary data infrastructures that
facilitate such digital disruption and the impact of edu-business involvement in this domain. It seeks
to understand the extent of the usage of apps in schools and classrooms, costs and effects on
teachersâ€™ work and professionalism, and student privacy. Finally, it explores the interaction
between technology and humans in assessment practices, including judgement making and the
consistency of judgement decisions.
Globalising school reform through online teacher professional learning
Role of Teacher Expertise, Authority and Professionalism in Education
Program two â€“ Data Innovation for Learning Progressions and Life Course in Teacher Education
This program investigates longitudinal data resources, collected by schools and government, to

model growth in studentsâ€™ academic achievements and to develop methodology for measuring
individual learning progression in disadvantaged student groups. It looks at processes for collecting
assessment data within schools using digital technology in order to identify the impact of digital
procedures on analysis and interpretation of results. Findings from the investigations will lead to
development of a data analytic infrastructure for use in enhancing student learning progression,
adding value in the school and community contexts.
Program three â€“ Digital Foundations in the Early Years
This program investigates the foundational knowledge required of young children in the early years
(birth to age eight) for their safe and productive participation in a digitally networked society. New
knowledge is needed concerning the development of young childrenâ€™s concept of digital,
alongside those of living and non-living to provide a foundation for young childrenâ€™s developing
understanding of networked technologies for young children, and in later years of schooling and well
into adulthood.
Connect with us
The centre welcomes enquiries about research projects and opportunities within the program areas
to collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of researchers who aim to generate new knowledge
about schooling reform and teacher education, with respect to research, policy and practice.

Research Centre for Studies of the Second Vatican Council
Title of slideshow
Based in the School of Theology, the Research Centre for Studies of the Second Vatican Council is

an international partnership between ACU, KU Leuven, and the University of Tilburg.
Our research
The Centre aims to investigate lines of inquiry that draw their inspiration from the Second Vatican
Council, among them, biblical theology, comparative theology and ecological theology.
Taking an integral approach, methodologically and thematically, research will focus on:
historical analysis of the Councilâ€™s antecedents;
studies of the Council itself; and
constructive treatments of the Councilâ€™s reception as well as developing trajectories that have
the Council and its documents as their inspiration.
Our people
Emmanuel Nathan - Centre Director
Dr Emmanuel Nathan is a Senior Lecturer in Biblical Studies and Comparative Theology and the
Director of the newly established Research Centre for Studies of the Second Vatican Council.
Originally specialising in New Testament studies and early Christian origins, his current research
interests are in the hermeneutics and comparative study of sacred texts and traditions in the
Abrahamic faiths.
His publications include: Provoked to Speech: Biblical Hermeneutics as Conversation (Peeters,
2014), Is there a Judeo-Christian Tradition: A European Perspective (De Gruyter, 2016) and
Re-membering the New Covenant at Corinth (Mohr Siebeck, 2020).
In 2020 he was named the inaugural Monsignor Professor Denis Edwards Visiting Scholar to the
Laudato Siâ€™ Research Institute at Campion Hall, University of Oxford.

Dr Antonia Pizzey - Postdoctoral Researcher
Antonia Pizzey completed her Ph.D. in Theology at ACU in 2016. Her dissertation focused on the
emerging method of Receptive Ecumenism and its connection to Spiritual Ecumenism. Her current
research explores the history, meaning and reception of Vatican IIâ€™s metaphor of the Church as

â€œpilgrimâ€•. She is a postdoctoral researcher for the five-year ACURF funded project: â€œThe
Vision of Vatican II on Revelation, Church, Ecumenism, and Educationâ€•, which is housed in the
Research Centre for Studies of the Second Vatican Council. She is also a Lecturer in ACUâ€™s
School of Theology. Her research interests include ecumenism, ecclesiology, Vatican II studies,
eschatology, and theological virtues, especially humility and hope.

Bridging the gender gap in sports science research
In August 2022, when world-class runner Dina Asher-Smith spectacularly slowed down halfway into
the womenâ€™s 100-metre final at the European Championships, she revealed that cramps related
to her period caused her to stop running. She went on to highlight the fact that menstrual cycles
have a huge impact on the performance of female athletes, and yet, very little research has been
conducted to examine its influence.
A passion for women's health
For much of recent history, pregnant women have been told to dial back the exercise â€“ keep it
simple and safe, and nothing too intense in case it harms the baby.
Lifting the silence on Australia's trans history
For as long as he can remember, Adrien McCrory has been fascinated with history. In high school,
he would regularly have his nose in a historical novel, or a textbook on medieval Europe or the
Russian revolution. He carried this passion into university, discovering his niche in contemporary
Australian crime history, and soon found himself reading old court transcripts, â€œjust for funâ€•.

ACU Strategic Plan 2023
Impact through Empathy
Since Australian Catholic University first opened in 1991, it has been an institution committed to
delivering excellence in education, research, and engagement. As a result, the university has
progressed from strength to strength. ACU now has eight campuses in Australia and another in Italy.
It is also currently ranked in the top 2% of all universities and is among the worldâ€™s top 10
Catholic universities. This impressive achievement stands testimony to the efforts of the many
people who have served ACU with passion and dedication over the past 30 years.
The ACU Strategic Plan 2020-2023: Impact through empathy was launched in 2019 by my
esteemed predecessor Professor Greg Craven AO GCSG.
This plan articulates ACUâ€™s mission, vision, focus, and strategic priorities for the coming years.
Significant steps have already been undertaken to meet its objectives. Few could have foreseen the
levels of global disruption and economic uncertainty which occurred in 2020. However, the ACU
Strategic Planâ€™s vision, with its focus on hope, faith, and reason through opportunity, innovation,
and ethics, proved to be robust and relevant during this challenging time.
As the new Vice-Chancellor and President of ACU, I am proud to be continuing with this plan as we
commence the next stage of the ACU journey.
As a university community, our collective purpose is neatly captured in the title of the plan â€“
Impact through empathy. This phrase reflects our intent to make a positive, lasting, and measurable
difference to students, staff, communities, and societies.
As we move forward, we will create impact by adhering to our Catholic mission and remaining
committed to the pursuit of knowledge, the dignity of the human person, and the common good. We
will continue to offer our students an inclusive, ethics-based education, and we will search for
solutions to local and global challenges through mission-aligned research. We will also support the
broader community and advocate for those who are unable to advocate for themselves.
As we work towards these shared objectives, I know that our hope, faith, and reason will provide us

with the fortitude we require to face any challenges which may lay ahead.
Professor Zlatko Skrbis
Vice-Chancellor and President
Australian Catholic University

ACU Student Retention Strategy
The ACU Student Retention Strategy is focused on identifying whole-of-university approaches to
improving student retention and success in alignment with our mission and values.
A student-centred experience
The strategy is student-centred and recognises the student experience from the point of first contact
with the University through to graduation. It is designed to address the challenges and opportunities
in the student lifecycle, with a focus on admission, learning and teaching, and co-curriculum.
We are aiming to provide our students with a wide range of opportunities for interaction and
engagement and to promote a sense of belonging in our community. We believe our goals will be
achieved through quality teaching and learning, a supportive academic culture and a student
experience that supports excellence.

Measuring our success
The successful implementation of the Student Retention Strategy will be monitored in line with
targets from the ACU Strategic Plan 2020 â€“ 2023, including student retention rates, student
satisfaction rates and student success rates.
Student participation and academic performance will be monitored to identify students who are at
risk of withdrawing and we will be aiming to put appropriate interventions in place. The effectiveness
of the strategy and the contributors to retention and success across the student lifecycle will be
regularly reviewed.
Our commitment to the Student Retention Strategy is recognised as a University priority and is a
responsibility for all staff.
Our six retention focus areas
Retention focus area 1: pathways, admission and transition
We will be engaging students with information, giving them course advice and an opportunity for
career planning. Nurturing a culture of belonging will be prioritised and we are aiming to create an
environment that promotes student engagement, retention and success.
Retention focus area 2: high-quality, student-centred learning and teaching
Through offering high-quality, student-centred learning and teaching experiences, students will
develop academically and in turn, staff will develop an understanding of their students. We will
develop a flexible course curriculum that offers options for course transfer within the University or
micro-credentialing to obtain recognition at different points of exit.
Retention focus area 3: student academic development, support and co-curricular engagement
Students who have the capacity to succeed in higher education will be given the best chance to
complete their studies through the appropriate provision of academic and other support services as
required by the Higher Education Standards Framework. Attention will be given to ensuring support
services are available to meet the needs of external students who are not regularly attending
campus, recognising they are at a higher risk of not completing their studies.

Retention focus area 4: student health, safety and wellbeing
Services to promote health and personal wellbeing to maintain studentsâ€™ capacity to study will
be made available, and a safe and inclusive environment will be promoted and fostered. A
university-wide mental health strategy is also in place to promote services and programs that
recognise the complexity and challenges of student life.
Retention focus area 5: students at risk of exiting or students who have disengaged
Student engagement will be monitored to identify at-risk students, and those who are identified as at
risk will be provided with targeted support interventions. Re-engagement opportunities will be
offered to students who have discontinued their enrolment from the University (including students
who have deferred, are on a leave of absence or have withdrawn).
Retention focus area 6: evidence-based practice and continuous improvement
This strategy is evidence-informed, underpinned by relevant student data and regularly evaluated
against indicators and measures of success. The retention, progression and completion
performance of courses will be monitored to inform the retention strategy and future interventions,
and learnings will be shared across the University.

ACU Student Mental Health Strategy and Implementation Plan
The ACU Student Mental Health Strategy and Implementation Plan was developed in response to
the increasing prevalence and complexity of mental health difficulties among university students.
These difficulties can significantly impact students and their capacity to study and succeed at ACU.
Our strategy takes a whole-of-university approach to improving student mental health and
addressing the risk factors. It outlines our commitment to fostering a safe and inclusive environment

that actively promotes positive mental health and wellbeing across the university.
Our objectives
We have identified four strategic objectives for the Student Mental Health Strategy and
Implementation Plan.
To raise awareness and promote positive mental health among ACU students.
To reduce any stigma associated with mental health conditions by enhancing mental health literacy
among ACU students and staff.
To facilitate a whole-of-university approach to supporting students with mental health difficulties,
giving them the best opportunities to continue and succeed in their studies.
To promote the wellbeing of all students by establishing sustainable preventative programs,
particularly targeting students who are at greater risk of experiencing mental health conditions or
difficulties.
Delivering the Mental Health Framework
Accessible and inclusive policies and procedures
Our policies and procedures are student-centred and provide appropriate interventions when
students are at risk of self-harm or harm to others.
University-wide mental health literacy
Workshops, training programs and online resources for students and staff will be made available to
increase mental health awareness.
Learning and teaching environment built on inclusive practices
Curriculum design and best practice teaching strategies will promote an inclusive environment and
enhance student wellbeing.
Supportive campus community
Students are given opportunities to develop a sense of belonging to their campus and build
connections.
Accessible support services

Students with temporary or ongoing mental health conditions or in identified high
risk groups will be offered targeted programs and support. Staff will be made aware of these support
services.
Effective early identification and response
Early identification of deteriorating mental health will be met with appropriate interventions.
Coordinated crisis management
A Critical Incident Management Framework directs staff on how to respond in crisis situations,
including incidents of self-harm or harm to others.

by the Commonwealth Government, but also a public company. Our incorporation allows us to
conduct ourselves as a Catholic university, and means we are governed in accordance with our
constitution.

Working alongside our Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Zlatko Skrbis, the members of our
leadership team are all responsible for a number of portfolios within the university from the four
Faculties to Student Administration.

Government, Policy and Strategy
The Government, Policy and Strategy (GPS) is responsible for managing high level public policy
issues and government relations on behalf of the University in a strategic and coordinated way.
The GPS supports the Universityâ€™s contributions to public policy debate to inform and shape the
development of sound public policy in areas of relevance to the University, particularly the higher
education sector and the regulation of the Universityâ€™s key disciplines. The GPS works
collaboratively with functional units across the University and with external stakeholders, including
Church stakeholders, to articulate and progress the Universityâ€™s public policy position in line with
its mission.
The GPS helps the University to set the public policy agenda in areas of major interest to the
University including in higher education, teacher education, health sciences, law, and business,
consistent with our role as a Catholic university.
The GPS maintains a watching brief on the external government and public policy environments as
they may impact the University, to strengthen the Universityâ€™s ability to predict and respond to
proposed policy changes. The dynamic nature of the political and public policy environment requires
the University to ensure that it maintains currency of knowledge by keeping abreast of the latest
developments in these areas.
The GPS provides policy advice and analysis, generates briefing papers, and prepares submissions
to government for the University in the following core policy areas:
Higher Education Policy
Teacher Education Policy
Health Policy

What if I am not Catholic?
You donâ€™t need to be Catholic to study with us. Across our university, staff and students of all
faiths â€“ or none â€“ work within the framework of respect for our mission and tradition, and commit
to the pursuit of knowledge, the dignity of the human person, and the common good.
Itâ€™s OK, everyoneâ€™s welcome
As a Catholic university, ACUâ€™s mission sits within the Catholic intellectual tradition. This
tradition encourages scholars and students to explore and challenge ideas based on Catholic
principles and values such as truth, honesty, integrity, peace, love and faith.
To understand what sets us apart, read through the key elements that make up our identity.
Our mission
We explore cultural, social, ethical and religious issues through the lens of our mission in teaching,

research and service. Our mission gives us a distinct perspective in higher education, and drives us
to make an impact for good.
Find out more about our mission
Catholic intellectual tradition
For 2,000 years, Catholic scholars have been reflecting on their faith and the world. The Catholic
Church developed the first universities to demonstrate the harmony between faith and reason.
Weâ€™re part of this long history, and we invite you to become part of it too.
Read more about our Catholic intellectual tradition
Catholicism on campus
We celebrate our Catholic faith on campus in many ways. Staff and students of all faiths are
welcome to join Mass, prayer services and reflections, and explore, challenge and expand their own
beliefs. Open, intelligent discussion from people of all faiths is a key part of our tradition.
Our Campus Ministry team also explores ideas around faith and Catholicism by organising
opportunities such as roundtables, seminars and retreats throughout the year.
Discover more about Catholicism on campus
Space for all faiths
We have multifaith prayer rooms for students of all faiths who want a quiet space to reflect, and all
are welcome to find respite from a busy and noisy world in our chapels.
And, in line with our focus on inclusivity and equity, students and staff from a wide range of faiths
share in and contribute to uni life at all ACU campuses.
Learn more about our values
So youâ€™re not Catholic?
You donâ€™t have to be Catholic to be committed to serving the common good and working to
improve the lives of the less fortunate in the world.
Our Catholic identity is evident in the values that inform our teaching; in the way we weave qualities
such as compassion, dignity and empathy throughout our degrees. But students of all beliefs benefit

from receiving an education that focuses on socially aware outcomes as well as academic results.
All we ask is for a genuine respect for our traditions and beliefs.
We donâ€™t expect all of our staff and students to share a single set of beliefs. And yet every day
youâ€™ll see our campus communities working together with respect and empathy to further our
mission and enhance the common good.
Do you need to be Catholic to join ACU? No. But you do need to commit to being greater.

"If the multigenerational poor are to make the leap out of poverty, it will require a new kind of
thinking â€” reflection. â€¦ And that is a beginning. â€¦ The study of the humanities is in itself a
redistribution of wealth. ... People who know the Humanities become good citizens, become active,
not acted upon."
Earl Shorris
Clemente founder, 1997

Sustainability at ACU
At ACU, weâ€™re committed to social justice, human dignity and the common good â€“ and our
sustainability as a university is integral.
In 2020 ACU developed a sustainability framework built upon two transformative prescriptions for a
better world: Pope Francisâ€™ encyclical Laudato siâ€™ and the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).
Our framework encompasses care for the environment, the fight against poverty and hunger,
education for all and the promotion of equality, peace and justice.

Our actions
Here are some of the steps we are taking to ensure our current and future sustainability.
Carbon and energy
Most of ACUâ€™s carbon emissions have come from its use of electricity and gas, its air travel, and
its disposal of waste to landfill. We are implementing a plan to eliminate, minimise or offset those
emissions.
Electricity: on 1 July 2021, ACU campuses became powered by 100 per cent renewable electricity.
This electricity is supplied by wind and solar farms throughout Australia and has eliminated about 85
per cent â€“ or 16,000 tonnes â€“ of ACUâ€™s carbon footprint.
Energy efficiency: We strive to constantly increase our energy efficiency, which we measure by how
much energy is used per square meter of the floor space of campus buildings. Using this measure,
ACU is Australia's most energy efficient university.
Air travel: From 01 January 2021, ACU implemented a policy to buy carbon offsets for every tonne
of greenhouse gas emitted by staff air travel. The carbon offsets will be purchased at the end of
every year from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities engaged in traditional land
management activities such as savannah burning.
Waste reduction
ACU aims to minimise the amount of waste that it sends to landfill. This requires ACU to reduce and
to recycle as much of its waste as possible.
Waste reduction: Since 2012, ACU has reduced the amount of waste it generates by 70 per cent. In
2012, ACU generated 1,170 tonnes of rubbish; in 2022, it generated just 380 tonnes, or about 16
kilograms per student, exactly half the amount of waste generated per student in the Australian

university sector.
There are two main reasons for this reduction: staff and students use much less paper, and ACU's
cafeterias produce much less food waste.
Recycling: ACU's recycling rate is consistently between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of its total
waste generation. ACU recycles paper, cardboard, plastic, electronic waste, garden waste and food
waste.
Plastic waste: ACU has a special focus on reducing plastic waste because plastic waste has a
heavy impact on our rivers and oceans.
Organic waste: In 2022 ACU introduced food waste collection into its campuses to complement its
garden waste recycling. ACUâ€™s food waste is composted and returned to gardens and farms to
support healthier soils and ACUâ€™s garden waste is mulched and then re-used on gardens. In
2022, ACU diverted over 40 tonnes of garden and food waste from landfill.
In 2020, ACU adopted a plan to cut its use of plastic during Orientation. This plan eliminated the
distribution of 10,000 water bottles, eliminated the use of plastic wrapping for promotional items, and
banned the use of balloons.
Water
ACU has water tanks with a combined capacity of 660,000 litres. Most of this water is used to water
campus grounds and to flush toilets.
ACU has also installed water efficient taps, toilets and showers throughout its campuses, and
landscapes its campuses with drought-tolerant plants.
These measures mean that ACU uses a small amount of water compared to most universities. The
amount of mains water used per student at ACU is 2.5 kilolitres; the average for all universities is
two and half times that amount.
Sustainable buildings
Most of ACUâ€™s environmental impacts arise from the energy and water used in its buildings as
well as the waste generated in them. For this reason, ACU now builds and renovates its campus

buildings to a high standard of sustainability.
For example, ACU now has three buildings certified by the Green Building Council of Australia,
verifying the exceptional sustainability of their design and construction. These buildings are the
Daniel Mannix Building at the Melbourne Campus, the Veritas Building at the Canberra Campus,
and the St Brigidâ€™s Building at the Ballarat Campus.
ACU has also finalised construction of the 13-storey Saint Teresa of Kolkata building at ACUâ€™s
Melbourne Campus, which is designed to achieve a 5-Star Green Star rating, indicating Australian
excellence in sustainable design.
Modern slavery
ACU is committed to preventing and ultimately eliminating the impact of modern slavery in its
operations, business partnerships and supply chain.
ACU has established a Modern Slavery Action Plan that includes:
Working with over 30 other Catholic entities as part of the Australian Catholic Anti-Slavery Network
to identify slavery risks, meet legal reporting standards, and train staff.
Establishing an ACU Eradicating Modern Slavery Working Group to ensure practical action in every
ACU Faculty and Directorate.
Learning and research into the causes of and solutions to modern slavery.
Naming ACUâ€™s Blacktown Campus in honour of St Josephine Bakhita, the patron saint of Sudan
and victims of modern slavery and human trafficking.
You can read more about ACUâ€™s commitment to combat modern slavery online as well as in its
annual Modern Slavery statement.
Research
ACUâ€™s research contributes to the common good and many research projects that aim to solve
the problems that hinder sustainable development worldwide. Examples of this research includes:
The application of organisational ethics to the Paris Climate Agreement, by Associate Professor
Stephanie Collins, which aligns to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11

(Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption) and 13 (Climate Action).
Investigations by the Institute of Positive Psychology and Education into the impact of Indigenous
education programs. This research aligns to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3
(Good Health and Wellbeing) and 4 (Quality Education).
Studies by the Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research into the link between urban pollution
and academic performance, advancing United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11
(Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 15 (Life on Land).
Learning
ACU students engage directly with the major questions about the common good and sustainable
development. They do this in their coursework as well as in the universityâ€™s core curriculum
subjects, which develop studentsâ€™ ability to examine the world with empathy and to imagine it
transformed for the better.
As part of the Core Curriculum, each student partakes in a discipline-specific community
engagement unit of study, working with communities that experience disadvantage and
marginalisation. Approximately 3,500 students undertake a community engagement placement each
year.
Sustainable finance
ACU was the first organisation in Australia and the first university in the world to issue a
sustainability bond, which offered investors the opportunity to participate in the financing of ACU
projects that deliver positive social and/or environmental results.
The value of the bond is $200 million, and those funds have been allocated to invest in sustainable
buildings and in research that delivers a positive impact in the areas of education, health care and
gender equality.

across 40 countries. These relationships support education abroad, staff mobility, collaborative
research, articulation and shared community engagement activities.
We welcome over 250 international students from our partner universities every year, thanks to
these connections. And more than 1000 of our own students engage in international learning
experiences annually.

Benefits of partnering with us
As Australiaâ€™s largest Catholic university, we provide our partners with access to an extensive
network of industry and community connections. We have six campuses across Australia, and serve
as a gateway to study and research collaborations in each region.
Plus, we have developed innovative learning models and academic pathways that may benefit our
partner institutions.
We continue to develop new, active partnerships with compatible international universities and
institutions to:
enhance our international research collaboration
internationalise our curriculum
provide excellent international opportunities for students
develop transnational education
increase our international teaching collaboration
achieve sustainable growth in international student enrolments.
Partnership types
We are open to a range of partnerships and collaborations â€“ from student exchanges to
Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs).

Key student-focused partnership types include:
Student exchange: Our 80-plus student exchange partnerships with universities around the world
give our students the life-changing experience to study overseas for their ACU degree, and vice
versa. No fees are involved for the host institution.
Study abroad: Study abroad partnerships let international students study at ACU on a fee-paying
basis. We welcome students from partner institutions each semester, and we also encourage
students from non-partner institutions to apply.
Student placement: We give students the opportunity to apply the theory and skills theyâ€™ve
gained while studying through hands-on experience. The student placement partnerships we form
with local and overseas institutions allow us to offer professional placements, clinical placements,
community engagement, practicums and more.
Articulation: Our articulation links with universities, colleges and other institutions give students with
prior study or qualifications the chance to have their past work recognised at ACU.
Study tours: We welcome study tour groups from partner institutions for short-term periods. Activities
can involve English classes, academic topics, and tours designed around specific student interests
and expertise.
View our full list of our partnership types
How to partner with us
You can establish a partnership with us on a formal or informal basis.
Formal partnerships
If you are a staff member at a university or institution seeking to establish a formal partnership with
ACU, please download, complete and return our International Partnership Proposal Form.
Download the International Partnership Proposal Form (PDF, 375KB)
Return your completed form by email to acuinternational.relations@acu.edu.au.
We establish international agreements, which formalise international partnerships, through a
process of consultation and approval in accordance with ACU rules and procedures.

Preparing and negotiating draft agreements can require extensive internal consultation, and our
ACU International Relations team will be able to advise on approximate time-frames once we
receive your proposal.
Tailored partnerships
If you are seeking to establish a formal partnership with ACU but your proposal does not align with
the partnership types listed above, a customised partnership model may be a further option.
You can find out more by emailing the ACU International Relations team at
acuinternational.relations@acu.edu.au.
Informal partnerships
Many partnerships originate through informal contact between staff at two or more institutions who
share similar interests.
For academic interactions of limited scope or duration, no formal agreements are necessary.
However, if there are sufficient activities and support for long-term collaboration and broader
institutional participation, then we recommend formal agreements.
Request a visit to ACU
We look forward to welcoming international visitors and delegations to our campuses. ACU is
committed to providing courteous and professional support, and we will endeavour to accommodate
all requests.
To request a visit to ACU, submit a visit request online. Upon receipt of the visit proposal, Global
and Education Pathways will assess the request and get in touch regarding the progress and

Directorates
Good directors talk about action, great directors take it. Get an overview of our organisational areas

normally called directorates â€“ the departments, offices, units and teams that ensure the day-to-day
running of ACU â€“ as well as the directors they report into.
On the path to impact
ACU is more than its campuses and cafes. Our university is a living, breathing ecosystem of
academics, staff and students, who each bring to it their skills and experience â€“ and willingness to
learn for a better world for everyone.
So this ecosystem flourishes, each directorate, faculty, office and unit is overseen by one or more
directors. These directors specialise in a vital function of the University, including learning and
teaching, student services, strategy, operations, academia and research.
Explore our directorates

Congratulations on a great outcome at the 2023 Indigenous Nationals. Winning the Touch Football
competition and being the overall runner up is a fabulous result. As back to back national winners
(2021 and 2022) you were always going to be the ones to beat and I think you've done an amazing
job.
Itâ€™s always inspiring how you come together the day before the weeklong event, learn each
other's names, train for one day and go straight into the competition. A big shout out to Herschel,
Sandy, Ben and Linc for the preparation, support and training. Thank you - youâ€™ve done an
awesome job.

entry requirements. You may also enhance your entry score by including short personal statements
that give ACU an insight into your personal circumstances and motivation for university study.

ACU holds special graduation for inspiring student
Media Release
08 August 2023
Share
ACU graduate Jade McAlear was in a coma following a horrific car accident when her distraught
parents Karen and Zac received her degree on her behalf last year.
But now the inspiring 24-year-old has accepted her Bachelor of Occupational Therapy award herself
in a special graduation ceremony organised by ACU's School of Allied Health and the Jim-baa-yer
Indigenous Higher Education Unit.
Tears of triumph and joy were shed by family, friends and ACU staff as Jade received her degree in
a moving ceremony in the amphitheatre of the university's new St Teresa of Kolkata Building.
Supported by her doting sisters Shai and Tyla, Jade walked across the stage to accept her award
from ACU Faculty of Health Sciences Deputy Dean Professor Justin Kemp.
Jade said she felt "lucky" to be able to graduate in person.
"I feel really honoured that ACU put on a graduation for just me," she said. "It's awesome."
Jade's proud mum Karen, an ACU-trained psychologist, said it was a different experience to last
year's ceremony.
"That was just so difficult. We just cried the whole way through - but it was amazingly respectful,"

she said. "This ceremony is just so special."
"ACU, even when I was there as a student, are just so supportive. It's an incredible institution."
Karen, whose youngest daughter Tyla also recently graduated from ACU with a paramedicine
degree, said it had been a long journey from Jade's accident in April last year to her graduation.
Jade, who was working as an occupational therapist at the time, suffered an acquired brain injury
and multiple fractures after a car accident when she just one kilometre from home after returning
from visiting a client.
She was in a coma for four months.
"We've only just been able to come up for air," Karen said.
"We've gone from nothing, just nothing. We are so lucky. It could have been so much worse."
With the support of medical and allied health experts, Karen is confident Jade, who has had several
surgeries on her hands and feet and has 22 therapy sessions per week including occupational
therapy, physiotherapy, swimming, and exercise therapy, will walk again.
Jade is also keen to restore strength to her hands so she can return to her passion for portraiture.
"I really want to get back to my artwork," she said. "I really want my hands working again."
And, unable to work as an occupational therapist, Jade and her family are also looking at ways she
can share her experience and raise awareness about acquired brain injuries with allied health
students and the wider community.
Jade's commitment to share her journey is being backed by ACU speech pathologist Danielle
Czapnik who, in a twist of fate, went from being one of her former lecturers to being on her Epworth
Hospital medical treatment team.
"It's vital to have an understanding of a person's lived experience and have empathy and
compassion along with using evidence-based practice," Danielle said.
"It's a very powerful thing to sit and listen and understand in order to be an outstanding therapist."
Danielle paid tribute to Jade's resilience and positive nature.
"I feel lucky and incredibly blessed to be on this pathway with Jade," she said.

"She is incredibly resilient. She's very inspiring, and overwhelmingly positive - the accident doesn't
define her."
Jim-baa-yer coordinator Linc Yow Yeh said the ceremony, which featured an academic procession
which included School of Allied Health academics Associate Professor Loretta Sheppard, Dr Liana
Cahill, Tammy Boatman, Alexandra Logan, Susan Darzins, and campus pastoral associate Jake
Santitto, celebrated the resilience and strength of the McAlear family.
"We feel very blessed that she (Jade) can be here today," he said.
Jim-baa-yer student success officer Madelaine Sealey said Jade's graduation ceremony was
designed to honour her story and her cultural connections as a First Nations woman.
"We feel so honoured and privileged to be able to celebrate Jade's graduation with her and her
family and friends. Our university community has thrown their weight behind this special day for
Jade and her family," she said.
"Jade's family have been so incredibly resilient throughout this whole time and there is so much love
from their family for Jade and for each other. It is such a blessing that Jade is alive and responding
well to her recovery.
"However, based on conversations with Jade's family these last few months, it is evident there is still
a lot for the family to manage moving forward in terms of Jade's recovery and ongoing care."

The Faculty of Education and Arts invites you to join us for the launch of the Australian Centre for
the Advancement of Literacy (ACAL). At ACAL, we believe that every student can learn to read and
write if the instruction they receive is based on the best scientific evidence available. ACAL is
committed to understanding how people learn to read and write, and to translating that knowledge
into effective teaching practices. We envision an Australia where every student leaving school has
the literacy skills they need to pursue their dreams and contribute to the common good.
'Cultivating Tomorrow's Readers: The Future of Early Literacy Education' is an engaging and
thought-provoking panel discussion that brings together educators and researchers to explore the
ever-evolving landscape of early literacy instruction.
Prof. Rauno Parrila, Director of ACAL, will chair the panel of experts including Prof. Genevieve
McArthur, Prof. Anne Castles, Prof. Don Compton, and Assoc. Prof. Saskia Kohnen (Macquarie
University).

ACU athletes shine at World University Games
Media Release
11 August 2023
Share
Australian Catholic University student athletes were amongst a string of world class UniRoos
performances that suggest international multi-sport championships can prosper.
Bronze medallist Alec Diamond joined six other ACU students at the FISU Summer World University
Games in Chengdu, China.
Queensland sprinter Reece Holder (QUT) set a meet record and an Olympic 400m qualifier and
there were countless other elite performances from the UniRoos.

Coming in the wake of speculation around hosting rights for the 2026 Commonwealth Games, the
high quality of competition was a timely reminder of the value of multi-sport events that provide a
launchpad for Olympic and world championship competition.
"As the Deputy Chair of University Sport Australia, I have watched the results from Chengdu with
interest," ACU director of sport, wellbeing and residential life Paul McJannett said.
"There absolutely is a place in the spotlight for multi-sport championships. These World University
Games in Chengdu showed that if you support student athletes in their academic and sporting
pursuits, they will step up."
Diamond, now a two-time medallist at the World University Games, had earlier made an impact as
Australia's flag-bearer at the opening ceremony.
"The Games were a great stepping-stone between the under-20 level and up into the opens," he told
Athletics Australia. "It's almost, and especially for multi-events, a perfect middle ground, so having
that as a goal and something to achieve really helped me with a bit of direction."
Joining Diamond as medallists in Chengdu were ACU Elite Athlete and Performer Program (EAPP)
student Will Thompson (bronze, men's 20km walk team) and water polo bronze medal winners Luci
Marsh and Maddy Powells.
Emily Britton was a semi-finalist in the women's 100m hurdles, clocking a world class 13.22secs.
Gymnast Lachlan Smith was a member of the Australian quintet that finished 14th in the men's
teams event and Ambrosia Landsberg was eliminated in the first round of the women's taekwondo.
ACU's student athletes have an incredible range of world class events available through FISU the
governing body including FISU World University games, FISU World University Championships and
the FISU University World Cups (3x3 basketball).

ACU researchers receive funding to provide a pathway to safer walking for older Australians
Media Release,Research
08 August 2023
Share

ACU researchers will develop a program to enhance pedestrian safety among older adults, thanks
to funding from the Australian Automobile Association (AAA).
Pedestrian deaths increased by 10.3% in the 12 months to June 2023 (to 161), while the National
Road Safety Strategy has also identified older people as vulnerable road users.
ACU health sciences researchers will develop a tailored online training program for people over 60
to enhance their hazard perception skills and reduce the risk of harm.
The program is the first of its kind in Australia and will use 3D simulations and gamification
alongside physical and cognitive training to allow older adults to respond safely to traffic-related
threats while walking.
Lead ACU researcher Dr Joanne Bennett from the National School of Behavioural and Health
Sciences said the online platform would achieve significant advancements in road safety.
"This cutting-edge platform enables older adults to enhance their hazard perception, physical, and
cognitive skills.
"The ultimate goal is to improve pedestrian safety and, potentially, driving safety as well.
"By supporting older adults in understanding and improving their core pedestrian-safety skills, this
pioneering initiative aims to help them live long, safe, and independent lives."
ACU will receive $820,000 to develop and deliver the innovative program over the next two years.
Associate Professor Jonathan Duckworth and Dr Li Ping Thong from RMIT University's School of
Design will collaborate with ACU researchers to build the online platform.
"Combining 3D simulated hazardous roadway scenarios with gaming elements to enhance user
engagement and motivation will provide a novel approach to tackle the pressing issue of pedestrian
injuries and fatalities among the ageing population in Australia," said Associate Professor
Duckworth.
"Considering the target audience of older adults, the program's design must focus on accessibility.
This involves ensuring the interface is easy to navigate, accommodating varying levels of digital
literacy, and supporting users with potential sensory or cognitive impairments."

The AAA funds research and practical activities that deliver real benefits for road users and the
community.
"This is a promising project that could prevent many deaths and injuries," AAA managing director
Michael Bradley said.
"Australian road death numbers are rising and our population is ageing. ACU's work is addressing
an important need and a major gap in the nation's road safety measures."

ACU launches Master of Liberal Arts
Media Release,Western Civilisation program
04 August 2023
Share
ACU has launched a Master of Liberal Arts (Western Civilisation) in partnership with the Ramsay
Centre.
The Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation will fund up to ten scholarships each year in the
Masters program, worth up to $48,000 over 1.5 years.
Centred on a 'great books' approach to the study of the intellectual and cultural inheritance of
Western civilisation, the Master of Liberal Arts is designed to give students a grounding in the
literature, music, philosophy and works of art that have achieved the status of â€˜classics' within the
Western world.
Course coordinator Associate Professor Johanna Harris said the degree was the first of its kind in
Australia.
â€œItâ€™s a rare gem in the Australian educational landscape,â€• she said.
â€œWe offer humanities degrees in the liberal arts tradition centred on the great works of Western
intellectual traditions and cultures from antiquity to the present.
â€œStudents get the chance to study the classics of literature, history, philosophy and art â€“ works
that have endured because they still have something to teach us, even after hundreds or thousands
of years.â€•
Assoc. Prof. Harris said the degree offered students the chance to come together for an open
exchange of ideas.
â€œThe course is taught by world-class academics with wide-ranging interdisciplinary expertise,â€•
Assoc. Prof. Harris said.
â€œThe small group seminar setting gives students the opportunity to participate actively in

discussions and allows for the open exchange of ideas, values and beliefs.â€•
Simeon Casey is one of the first cohort in the Master of Liberal Arts program and said it was the
opportunity of a lifetime.
â€œI desire exposure to all the thought and imagination that lies in the great books of Western
Civilisation because so many images are contained within them that say something about what life
is, about what is true and what is beautiful,â€• he said.
â€œAs I progressed through my Bachelor degree I came to appreciate more and more the process
of 'slow reading',â€• he said.
â€œI enjoyed looking at great books for an extended period and wrestling with the complexities they
contain.
â€œA degree like this is key to understanding so much more of what it means to be human and how
to live my life.
â€œI hoped the Master of Liberal Arts at ACU would offer me an opportunity to delve into literature
and philosophy under the guidance of teachers who have immersed themselves for years in great
books. In only the first week of classes I have been more than confirmed in this hope.â€•
Simeon said he was grateful to receive a generous scholarship from the Ramsay Centre.
â€œI no longer have to work full time and juggle university, Iâ€™m so grateful I can really commit to
the study set before me.â€•
Ramsay Centre Academic Director Professor Diana Glenn said the degree was the first
Masterâ€™s level course the Centre has supported in Australia; part of a deliberate decision to
expand the potential reach of the Centreâ€™s immensely popular Western Civilisation courses to a
broader audience.
â€œWe wanted to ensure that Australians already in established careers and in the workforce could
also access this remarkable education,â€• Professor Glenn said.
â€œThe Great Books have so much to teach us at all life stages and the critical thinking skills
acquired through their study, as well as the creativity they inspire will be an asset in the future

careers of those who study them at the Masterâ€™s level.â€•
â€œACUâ€™s exceptional curriculum encourages students to take a deep dive into fundamental
and universal questions that have exercised the human mind and spirit for millennia. The course is
already attracting professionals in the workforce who are drawn to the prospect of a stimulating
engagement with the interdisciplinary readings on offer.â€•

Media Release
04 August 2023
Share
The Blacktown Campus has kicked off Australian Catholic Universityâ€™s open day events for
2023.
Open days are a one-stop-shop to help make an informed choice about higher education and career
pathways. ACUâ€™s newest campus in Blacktown saw a 30 per cent increase in prospective
student attendance, and with similar events approaching across the remaining six Australian
campuses, Associate Director, Future Students, Caroline Taouk has encouraged school leavers,
non-school leavers and those considering postgraduate study to explore ACUâ€™s varied pathways
and course offerings.
â€œItâ€™s a big decision, no doubt,â€• she said. â€œWhy wouldnâ€™t you take the chance for a
deep dive into the place where youâ€™re planning to spend the next few years?â€•
â€œItâ€™s a showcase. Open days are your window of opportunity to discover the things you
canâ€™t learn from a website or a course guide. It allows you to feel your way through the campus
and see if itâ€™s the right fit for you.
â€œGetting face to face with a lecturer or a current student, or even just chilling in the student
spaces, can equip you to make an informed decision.â€•

Over the next six weeks, ACU staff, researchers, lecturers and student ambassadors will deliver
scores of presentations, campus tours and information sessions across its open day events â€“
alongside plenty of hands-on activities that you can have a little fun with.
Visitors to open day events have the chance to ask questions about entry pathways, including
ACUâ€™s unique Veteran Entry Program for Australian Defence Force (VEP) personnel and their
families.
Learning and disability support, student accommodation, career pathways, campus life, class sizes
and fees are also hot topics.
It is also an opportunity to discover information about ACUâ€™s Elite Athlete and Performer
Program that supports students in achieving their active and academic goals, and the ACU
Guarantee program that offers eligible Year 12 students a place at ACU based on their Year 11
results.

ACU's Canberra campus celebrates 60 years
Media Release,Vice-Chancellor and President
02 August 2023
Share
ACU's Signadou campus in Canberra is celebrating its 60th anniversary this week.
The diamond jubilee celebration will pay tribute to the Dominican sisters whose commitment to
education for women, by women shaped the foundation of the campus and empowered generations
of students.
The Signadou Dominican College of Education was officially opened in 1963 by then Prime Minister,

Sir Robert Menzies. The vision was simple: to create an environment where women had the
freedom and opportunity to teach and learn from one another.
The Dominican sisters included First Nations women in this journey, embracing diversity and
inclusion as integral elements of their educational philosophy.
Against the backdrop of the late 1950s and early 1960s, a time when women still struggled to
receive an education in many parts of the world, the Dominican Sisters paved the way for
generations of women to access higher education.
In the first year, a total of 19 students graduated, and the college went on to become a major
provider of primary school teachers for Canberra and beyond.
Over the years, it has expanded to include research institutes and centres, while also offering
courses in education and many other disciplines, including social work, nursing, paramedicine,
midwifery and theology.
The College was one of four Catholic tertiary institutions that contributed to the creation of ACU in
1991, playing an instrumental role in laying the foundations for the University.
The 60th anniversary celebrations with former staff and students are being held on the Feast of St.
Dominic, the patron saint of Signadou.
ACU Vice-Chancellor and President Professor Zlatko Skrbis said the milestone celebrated a legacy
of transformative education that had shaped lives and communities.
"The spirit of the visionary women who founded Signadou continues to resonate through our
institution, inspiring us to uphold their commitment to knowledge, service, and empowerment,"
Professor Skrbis said.
"This anniversary is a reminder of our shared journey, and the significant impact of ACU's Signadou
Campus on the higher education landscape in Australia.
"We look forward to creating a future where the pursuit of knowledge and social responsibility
remain at the heart of all we do."
ACU Canberra Campus Dean, Associate Professor Darius von Guttner, said the anniversary was an

opportunity to celebrate the rich history of the Signadou Campus and its transformational impact on
Canberra's inner north, and commit to the future of excellence in education.
"As we celebrate this significant occasion, we not only honour the sacrifices of the educational
pioneers but also look ahead with great optimism and enthusiasm for the bright future that lies
ahead for ACU Canberra," Associate Professor von Guttner said.
"Over the past six decades, our campus has nurtured countless bright minds, instilling in them the
values of service, leadership, and faith."

ACU hospital ward simulation readies health students for real deal
Media Release
02 August 2023
Share
Acute stroke care, a drug overdose, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, end of life care and distressed
relatives were among the critical scenarios presented to Australian Catholic University students in a
lifelike simulation of a typical workday in a busy hospital.
Multi-million dollar simulation labs, dubbed St Judeâ€™s Ward, across six of the universityâ€™s
seven Australian campuses provided a safe and authentic hospital setting for nursing, occupational
therapy, physiotherapy and speech pathology students to experience the realistic demands of
applying their knowledge and skills to manage multiple patients.
The complex and innovative unit utilised a combination of high-tech manikins and nursing students
in the role of simulated patients.
An assortment of surgical, medical, mental health and critical care presentations were cared for by
the interprofessional team. To add further realism, supervising lecturers were hands-off, instead
acting as either a unit manager, doctor, allied health supervisor or upset relative to bring the
innovative Interprofessional Ward for a Day project to life.
More than 2200 health science students across third year nursing, speech pathology and
physiotherapy students, together with fourth year occupational therapy students worked on the edge
of their expertise and learned with, from and about their professions and themselves in the process.

â€œIt felt very real. But it was nice to have other student nurses around to support me,â€• third year
nursing student Cara Jimenez said after her shift at the simulation lab in Brisbane.
â€œIt was stressful but good.â€•
Interprofessional Ward for a Day demanded the students work in teams over three days in six-hour
shifts.
Students attended the simulation as part of their unit requirements and over the three shifts
experienced the realities of delivering patient care in a simulated Australian hospital environment.
While not life or death in a real sense, they managed a mix of clinical scenarios at St Judeâ€™s, all
the while testing their knowledge and skills.
â€œThere were no acting awards handed out, but this was an enormously valuable exercise for the
students,â€• ACUâ€™s Victorian head of the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Paramedicine
Elisabeth Jacob said.
â€œThe students have the skills. And traditionally simulation learning is based on one patient or
one skill at a time.
â€œBut thatâ€™s not real life is it? Itâ€™s invaluable for the students to collaboratively manage up
to a 10-bed ward while experiencing various distractions and interventions, within an
interprofessional team.â€•
Among her patients, fourth year occupational therapy student Zoe Woodman treated a stroke
patient who had experienced right-sided weakness.
â€œIt felt quite real,â€• she said. â€œI like having these practical simulations, especially going into
(professional) placement.
â€œYou feel more prepared.â€•
Safety was a priority at all times, with students engaging in debriefing at the end of each shift and
having access to counselling with qualified staff during the immersive exercise.
The simulation labs will be a feature of Australian Catholic Universityâ€™s 2023 Open Day events.

ACUâ€™s new metabolic chamber only one of its kind in southern hemisphere
01 August 2023
Share
The Australian Catholic University will open a state-of-the-art human metabolic chamber at its
Melbourne campus â€“ the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere.
This will reinforce ACUâ€™s position at the forefront of metabolic disease, exercise, and dietary
research world-wide.
Designed and built by the world-leading team from Maastricht Instruments in the Netherlands, the
metabolic chamber, also known as a whole-room calorimeter, will be installed before the end of the
year with the first human studies scheduled to take place in early 2024.
The director of the Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research, Professor John Hawley, said the
new facility would strengthen the existing health research capacity of ACU, specifically in the areas
of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, sleep, circadian biology, and sports nutrition.
â€œIt will enable our academic and industry research partners to translate research into clinical
practice with targeted tangible outcomes for people living with life-threatening conditions, including
obesity and Type 2 diabetes,â€• Professor Hawley said.
â€œIt will provide us with a new tool to investigate Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs) â€“
one of the threats to the health and performance of athletesâ€•.
â€œObesity and Type 2 diabetes are two metabolic risk factors that lead to cardiovascular disease
and premature deaths, so new approaches are needed to capture the dynamics of acute and
chronic interventions, which are important for changes to lifestyle or habitual behaviour.â€•
Professor Hawley said research on the relationship between sleep and circadian biology was
gaining traction, as the effects of our 21st century â€œround-the-clockâ€• lifestyle are directly linked
to a rise in many metabolic conditions.
â€œTo investigate fluctuations in daily circadian rhythms in response to interventions such as
exercise, different meal patterns and disruptions to sleep, whole-room calorimeters are the gold

standard due to the control of dark-light cycles and other environmental cues,â€• Professor Hawley
said.
In the case of athletes, a mismatch between energy intake and the energy cost of training and
competition can lead to adaptations that cause the body to shut down â€œunnecessaryâ€• body
functions in the face of energy scarcity.
â€œThe chamber will allow us to learn how an athleteâ€™s body reduces its metabolism when it
perceives the athlete is under-eating or over-exercising - and distinguish whether this is a temporary
and reversible change, or a long-term threat to health and performance.â€•
Whole-room calorimeters are airtight rooms which monitor energy expenditure while sleeping,
resting, and exercising as well as assessing the thermic effect of food. Patients or trial participants
can live in the room overnight or in the case of chronic studies, for up to several days.
Fresh air is circulated into the room and as it flows out, a series of analysers measure the ratio of
carbon dioxide and oxygen in real-time. This allows researchers to determine the contribution of the
foods we eat (made up of fat, carbohydrate, and protein) to energy expenditure over the time spent
in the chamber. Changes in the â€œfuel mixâ€• are able to be detected after various interventions,
such as over-feeding and energy deficit due to exercise.
â€œIt will allow researchers to perform an overnight resting metabolic rate measurement, take blood
and other body samples, and even monitor a person over several days,â€• Professor Hawley said.
The new ACU chamber, also the largest in the Southern hemisphere, is â€œstate-of-the-artâ€• and
is the result of 35 years of world-leading metabolic research from the Metabolic Research Unit
Maastricht (MRUM) in the Netherlands.
ACUâ€™s Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Enterprise Professor Abid Khan said the new
facility would complement the Universityâ€™s existing health research facilities and unlock new
avenues of research for academic and industry research partners.
â€œWe are very excited to bring this to ACU and for it to be the only one of its type in the southern
hemisphere,â€• Professor Khan said.

â€œIt will deliver value to partners who will be able to access it and our experts to further their
research,â€• Professor Khan said.
ACU Vice-Chancellor and President Professor Zlatko Skrbis said the project confirmed the
university's status as a leader in healthcare research.
"This will enable our university to make an important contribution to global health outcomes,"
Professor Skrbis said.
"It will also allow us to support the next generation of Australian healthcare research leaders and
foster new collaborative opportunities."
Key features include:
Two fully equipped rooms for short-term (overnight) or extended stays (several days)
Extensive physiological and environmental data acquisition system delivering traceable raw data
and calculated parameters
Advanced environment control system for temperature and humidity
Sampling interfaces for blood, urine, faeces
Environmental control (hypoxia, lighting), different room configurations, or additional physiological
measurements (physical activity, ECG, heart rate, respiration rate, body temperature, skin
temperature, blood pressure, blood glucose).

Research stories
Long-term vision the key for teacher shortfall
The national discussion around the shortage of teachers provides a rich opportunity to find solutions
to problems that are years in the making.
Bridging the gender gap in sports science research
In August 2022, when world-class runner Dina Asher-Smith spectacularly slowed down halfway into
the womenâ€™s 100-metre final at the European Championships, she revealed that cramps related
to her period caused her to stop running. She went on to highlight the fact that menstrual cycles
have a huge impact on the performance of female athletes, and yet, very little research has been
conducted to examine its influence.
How historical research benefits communities in the here and now
There is a popular aphorism, one that is often attributed to the British statesman Winston Churchill

but which was likely first coined by Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, that declares:
â€œThose who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.â€•

About allied health
Health practitioners help us live life to the fullest. They get us back on the pitch after a sporting
injury, help us communicate effectively and support us to participate in the things important to us.
They also work hard in the background, preventing disease, advocating governments and keeping
whole communities safer, happier and healthier. When you choose a career in allied health, your
work could impact anyone from an individual to a community. As an ACU graduate, you will be
shaped by our mission to be agents of change, and to serve the common good.
Innovative facilities and clinics
When you study an allied health program with us, youâ€™ll learn more than theory. Youâ€™ll begin
in hands-on practical and simulation spaces then have the opportunity to take your skills out into the
real world, including the ACU health clinics that are located on several campuses. These
industry-based placements will be supervised by our specialist professional practice educators.
Professional recognition
Access a world beyond the classroom through our industry partners. These connections will provide
you with unique opportunities for clinical placements and even future employment. Plus, your ACU
degree will be recognised by Australiaâ€™s peak health bodies including Speech Pathology

Australia, Occupational Therapy Australia and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.
Study health worldwide
Your health studies can take you anywhere, literally. Start by studying a unit at our Rome Campus
and who knows where it may lead you. Exchanges and community placements in the health sector
are available in a range of countries.
Workplace experience
We know your best way ahead is through practical experience. Our community engagement and
professional practice placements form a large part of our health degrees. And, just like in the real
world, our degrees are interprofessional. Youâ€™ll learn to collaborate with other health
professionals, finding the best outcomes for your clients and patients, as well as the wider
community.

Student profile
Henry Jones
Physiotherapy student
â€œI love how hands-on all of my subjects are. The teachers make sure there are lots of practical
classes to ensure we get plenty of time to practise all of the manual techniques weâ€™re learning,
and thereâ€™s always a staff member around to give us tips and help out.
Physio is a career where you get the chance to help people get moving and functioning again. I
hope to make an impact by assisting people to achieve their sporting goals and to extend their
active life for as long as they possibly can.â€•

Student profile
Alexander Aloschi-Hopfner
Bachelor of Commerce (Marketing and Management)
â€œThe opportunity to undertake a placement during my studies has enhanced my knowledge and
experience in so many ways. Typically, being in a class room you learn the theory but, in many
cases, you donâ€™t know how to apply the knowledge or when. The opportunity to complete a
placement whilst studying has allowed me to understand the concepts of work-life-balance and
industrial knowledge. Receiving guidance by those who directly work in the industry, I experienced
unexpected and unplanned situations; be it complex, basic or hindering stress. Without this
placement, I do not think that I would be where I am today with my improvement in business skills,
personal qualities and knowledge.â€•

About creative arts
As the world gets smaller, itâ€™s more important than ever to create meaningful connections with
other people. A career in visual arts, creative arts or communications gives you a voice to cut
through societyâ€™s noise and make a difference to the lives of others. Whether your medium is
video or violin, poetry or pottery, weâ€™ll teach you how to make your mark remarkable.
Real-world facilities
Our state-of-the-art facilities will give you the foundation to forge your own path in creative and

visual arts. Each of our campuses has a public art gallery that runs exhibitions by students and
experienced artists throughout the year. You can also hone your skills at our art studios, video and
sound production studio, and multimedia facilities.
Study abroad in Rome
For creativity to flourish and good communication to be effective, you need to understand your
audience. One way we encourage this empathy is by sending you out into the world. Study with us
and you might find yourself meeting the curator of the Venice Biennale on an art tour of Italy or
touring Washington Square before taking in a Broadway musical in New York.
Workplace experience
When it comes to employability, real-world industry experience is just as important as learning the
theory behind your chosen discipline. Thatâ€™s why we ask that you extend yourself beyond the
classroom by putting what youâ€™ve learnt into practice during internships, industry placements,
professional experience and work-integrated learning. Our compulsory community engagement unit
also encourages you to use your new skills to support other communities and gain an understanding
how your creative practice can influence, impact and support others.
Professional recognition
Our industry partnerships provide rich learning experiences and opportunities for collaboration.
These relationships will give you a head start in connecting to practitioners in your chosen field, and
allow you to gain practical skills through internships and professional placements. Then, when you
graduate, you will have access to professional bodies such as the Australian Graphic Design
Association, the Australian Network for Art and Technology, Craft Australia and the International
Council of Museums.

About global studies and international development
Step out of the classroom and onto the world stage. When you study in the field of global studies,
youâ€™ll learn to see complex international issues, relations and a changing society through the
lens of an informed global perspective. If you want to make a difference in a world of differences, a
career in global studies or international development could be for you.
A double degree at ACU
Our Bachelor of Global Studies is offered as part of a double degree. You can choose to pair it with
a degree in applied public health, arts, business administration, commerce, law or theology, giving
you greater insight into sustainability, economic change, world politics and justice. All Bachelor of
Global Studies students spend a semester abroad, either studying at a partner university or doing
an internship to gain invaluable international experience.
Your compassion is key
Our mission includes a commitment to the pursuit of knowledge, the dignity of the human person
and the common good. Our international studies courses have our mission at their core. As the
world gets smaller, we ensure that you have the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to
engage compassionately, ethically and professionally with communities around the world.
Global understanding
There is so much more to learn about international studies than can be taught in a classroom.
Thatâ€™s why many of our international studies degrees have overseas experiences built into
them. Our global studies degrees include a semester studying abroad, while the Bachelor of
International Development Studies includes an immersion program with an NGO in a developing
country.
Learn another language
Pair an international studies degree with a Diploma in Languages to give yourself an edge in a
competitive international job market. You can complete the diploma at the same time as your
degree, taking classes part-time as intensives or outside of the standard semesters. We currently

offer the diploma in Italian and Spanish.

Student profile
Louis Kuhlmann
Bachelor of Arts (Honours)
â€œSo many of my teachers at ACU have been hugely influential. I can say with complete

confidence that I am a far different person now than who I was at the beginning of my degree.
Being a smaller university, you have an opportunity to really get to know your teachers. In my
experience, all of them are genuinely interested in getting to know their students too. This has been
invaluable to my learning.
Coming here I made a conscious effort to get involved in the things I was interested in, rather than
the things I thought had some practical value to help me reach some destination. It has allowed my
university experience to be much more about discovering my passions and making my career fit me,
rather than the other way around â€•
Staff profile
Dr Marguerite Nolan

Her current research project explores the role of book clubs as civic spaces in Australian cultural
and social life.

About nursing, midwifery and paramedicine
Nurses, midwives and paramedics are there for us when we need it the most. They help us keep our
health on track, provide critical care and even save lives. With a career on the health care frontlines,
youâ€™ll have the power to improve the wellbeing of others and be there to provide vital care to the
most vulnerable people in the community.
Facilities and clinics
Your nursing, midwifery and paramedicine studies will have a practical component. Youâ€™ll train
in simulation facilities like simulated wards and fully-fitted ambulances, complete with realistic
â€˜patientsâ€™. These innovative spaces are as close as you can get to real-world hospital
environments, so youâ€™ll get plenty of experience even before your placements with real patients.
Study health overseas
During your course, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to experience nursing and midwifery overseas.

Our short-term international study programs can take you to Timor Leste, Vanuatu, the USA,
Singapore, Chile and many more destinations, where youâ€™ll study at a partner university or put
your skills into practice at local health clinics. Plus, you can choose to study at our Rome Campus.
Professional recognition
Our health courses are known for developing health professionals who are compassionate,
competent and have a social conscience. Once youâ€™ve graduated you can apply for registration
with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and our paramedic graduates are eligible
for membership with Paramedics Australasia. Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor Paramedicine
graduates are also accredited by the Council of Ambulance Authorities, giving you a competitive
advantage over other graduates with state ambulance services.
Workplace experience
Go beyond the classroom with hands-on work experience. Our nurses and midwives will gain 800
hours of clinical practice by the time they graduate, working in placements with our industry partners
such as aged care and mental health facilities, and leading hospitals. Midwifery students will also
have the opportunity to engage with at least 10 women to follow their pregnancy, labour, birth and
postnatal-care journey. Our paramedicine students will undertake a minimum of 360 hours of clinical
practice within and emergency or simulated emergency setting.

A day in the life of an ACU paramedicine student
Meet our students and staff
Alumni profile
Mihai Gavrilescu
Paramedicine student

â€œThereâ€™s a lot of practical work at ACU, which I really enjoy. Our placements are out on the
road with ambulances. Thereâ€™s definitely that adrenaline rush when you go to something
youâ€™ve never seen before. But the way in which these situations can be calmed down appeals to
me. The calmer it is, the better the outcome.
I like the problem-solving part of paramedicine and the ability to have an immediate impact.
Treatment isnâ€™t always about giving drugs or stopping the bleeding. Being supportive is
treatment in itself. â€•

About philosophy
If youâ€™ve got big questions, a degree in philosophy can give you the analytical skills to explore
them. Studying philosophy deepens your thinking and teaches you to analyse, understand and
engage with complex ideas. It teaches reasoning, logic and critical thinking â€“ skills you can apply
to every part of your life, whatever career path you go down.
World-class education
When you study with us, youâ€™re choosing to learn from world-leading philosophy teachers and
researchers. In fact, our research performance in philosophy has been rated above world standard
in the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) rankings. We pride ourselves on the mark we
make â€“ especially in the fields of ethics, the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy.
Skills for any profession
The skills youâ€™ll gain from a degree in philosophy can be transferred to just about any
profession. Youâ€™ll develop clarity of thought, first-class analysis and research skills, excellent
communication skills and an openness to new ideas. Our graduates have gone on to apply these
skills in the fields of law, business, education, psychology and counselling, government and
research.
Partnerships
Study philosophy with us and access our network of national and international partnerships,
including the Plunkett Centre for Ethics â€“ a joint centre shared with St Vincentâ€™s Health
Australia, NSW Facilities and Calvary Health Care. The centre is dedicated to the study of ethical

About psychology
Psychology is the study of the human mind and behaviours. Psychologists put that knowledge to
work in all sorts of fields, from counselling to teaching to market research. When you study
psychology, youâ€™ll discover the inner workings of the mind and learn the skills to provide
meaningful insight and support to others, when they need it most.
Choose your own path
To register as a psychologist in Australia, you must complete six years of full-time training. We offer
a number of paths to reach this, with two three-year APAC-accredited undergraduate psychology

degrees and a number of postgraduate programs in psychology that include masterâ€™s degrees
in professional, clinical, and educational and developmental psychology. As a student with us, you
can choose the best combination of courses to achieve your goals.
Facilities and clinics
Your psychology studies will give you more than just the theory. During your postgraduate studies,
youâ€™ll learn in our clinic facilities, where you'll work with real clients under the supervision of
registered psychologists. The Melbourne Psychology Clinic and the Mary Aikenhead Clinic (the
Strathfield psychology and counselling clinic) offer counselling and psychological assessments to
the general community at a low cost and allow you to get practical experience as part of your
degree.
Professional recognition
Our courses are accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) and
approved by the Psychology Board of Australia. Learn from practitioners and clinicians who are
actively involved in professional associations and community services, and gain real-world insights
from respected industry professionals.
Study overseas
A degree at ACU can lead you to study just about anywhere in the world. Youâ€™ll have the
opportunity to study core units at our Rome Campus or choose to study for a semester or two at one
of our partner universities in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The big question is, where can
psychology take you?

Student profile
Samuel Robinson
Public health student
â€œI enjoyed the practical experience during my student placements. Itâ€™s one thing learning the
skills in a classroom or a textbook, but itâ€™s another thing to put them into practice in the real
world and interact with real people and their problems. Suddenly itâ€™s not just a Word document
on my laptop.
During my practical experience, I was exposed to just how powerful health promotion is in the
prevention of health issues. I hope to make an impact by improving awareness and education about
the modifiable risk factors of preventable, non-communicable diseases.â€•

About teaching and education
We all have that one teacher whose influence continues to push us to be our best selves years after
weâ€™ve left their classroom. Our teaching and education courses give you the tools to be that
teacher that students remember and, just as importantly, mentor and lead the next generation of

educators. We are ranked in the top 100 for education worldwide so, whether youâ€™re coming into
a course straight from high school or have already logged countless hours in front of a whiteboard,
weâ€™ll be able to introduce you to the most effective ways to inspire learning, spark ambition and
impact the future.
Admission pathways
There are multiple ways to get into teaching at ACU. If you didnâ€™t meet the entry requirements
for your course, completion of a pathway course could lead to a teaching degree. Previous work
experience, tertiary study or volunteering may also give you the edge you need.
Study teaching, reach the world
When you study at ACU, you could do a placement in remote or rural Australia, find yourself in a
classroom on a remote Pacific island, in Nepal or in South Africa or do a study tour in Rome.
Whatever your journey, ACU offers a number of scholarships to support you on your way.
Learn in the classroom
Our hands-on initial teacher education courses put you in front of the class. Youâ€™ll get to teach in
schools at different stages of your course to ensure your practical experience evolves alongside
your theoretical knowledge base. Our placement program also gives you diverse classroom
experiences, so youâ€™ll be in a better position to choose your future career path. Our primary and
secondary teaching degrees can also prepare you to teach in Catholic, government and other
faith-based schools within Australia.
Leadership in schools
We offer a diverse range of programs across early childhood, primary and secondary education,
disability and inclusion contexts, religious education and leadership development. Our courses are
designed and accredited in collaboration with industry experts from Catholic education, government
sector, independent schools and international partners to ensure we continue to respond to industry
and accreditation needs and incorporate the latest in pedagogical innovation.

A day in the life of an ACU teaching and arts student
Meet our students and staff
Student profile
Nicholas Fengaros
Current student
Nicholas Fengaros is a fourth-year student studying a Bachelor of Education (Primary). He is a
Golden Key recipient and part of the NETDS Program at ACU; a program which allows
high-achieving pre-service teachers to help in disadvantaged schools.
Nicholas chose to study at ACU because of our reputation and â€œconnection of friendship,
community and care.â€•
Teaching has been Nicholasâ€™s dream job since he was eight years old; seeing it as not just a
job, but an opportunity. Educating, inspiring and providing students with opportunities for academic
growth and personal transformation is something Nicholas is very passionate about and he aspires
to make a difference in othersâ€™ lives through education. The greatest gift he can give to his
students is â€œthe love of endless learning; each student has the potential to bring something
unique and exceptional to the world.â€•
According to Nicholas, education courses at ACU provide a â€œhigh level of knowledge and
professional skills necessary to foster innovative pedagogy.â€• Due to our small class sizes and
sense of community, students like Nicholas form positive professional relationships with tutors and
lecturers as they inspire and mentor cohorts through their studies.
Nicholas has also undertaken many placements and community engagement practicums that have
prepared him to enter the workforce. Nicholas believes that while no two placements are the same,
every placement has shaped the teacher he will become. Mentoring his students and hearing them

say â€œGood morning Mr Fengarosâ€• has confirmed he is moving in the right direction.

About theology
Theology is for those who are curious about the origin, nature and future role of religion in society.
Itâ€™s for those with inquisitive and enquiring minds; those eager to probe the foundations of the
Christian faith, the development of its central teachings and philosophies, and its relationship with
the modern world. Study theology with us to explore questions of knowledge, of identity and of
value, and uncover the meaning and significance of understanding.
Skills for life
The study of theology is a transformational journey. Whichever career path and life journey you
choose, the study of theology will challenge you to think of the reasons behind your choice, your
purpose, your goals and the contribution you will make to your world.
Study worldwide
Take your studies around the world with opportunities to study theology in some of the worldâ€™s
most sacred and historically significant places, including at our Rome Campus, in Israel and the
Philippines. Or you can choose to study for a semester with one of our partner institutions in Europe
or the USA.
Theology for life and career
Whatever your career or vocational goals, or your stage on the journey of faith, our theology courses
are designed to assist you. Choose from a range of short courses, certificate and bachelor
opportunities, postgraduate coursework programs, professional and research degrees, international
study tours, and a wide range of professional development.
World-class learning
When you choose to study with us, youâ€™re choosing to learn from world-leading theology
teachers and researchers. In fact, our research performance in theology has been rated above
world standard in the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) rankings.

Student profile

Louwana Saba
Master of Theological Studies
â€œI always had an interest in the study of theology and found that ACU was a best fit for me being
a national university with highly regarded professionals in the field. It is one of few Australian
universities with a dedicated School of Theology and Philosophy!
â€œWhile boasting a large scale, well-regarded tertiary institute, ACU for me also has a big
high-school feel to it. The lecturers learn to know you, you develop a rapport with your peers, and
the sense of familiarity that resonates in the place, enables a fruitful and more meaningful
experience in your academic journey. I was not just a number, a student out of thousands â€“ but a
person with interests and abilities.â€•

Message from First Peoples Director
Congratulations on a great outcome at the 2023 Indigenous Nationals. Winning the Touch Football
competition and being the overall runner up is a fabulous result. As back to back national winners
(2021 and 2022) you were always going to be the ones to beat and I think you've done an amazing
job.
Itâ€™s always inspiring how you come together the day before the weeklong event, learn each
other's names, train for one day and go straight into the competition. A big shout out to Herschel,
Sandy, Ben and Linc for the preparation, support and training. Thank you - youâ€™ve done an

awesome job.

Faith and Values
As a Catholic university, we draw our inspiration from the â€œheart of the Churchâ€•, building on
the ancient tradition which gave rise to the first universities in medieval Europe. This Catholic
intellectual tradition proposes an integrated spiritual and philosophical approach to the most
enduring questions of human life.

A university of faith
ACU's Blacktown Campus is named in honour of St Josephine Bakhita, patron saint of Sudan and of
victims of slavery. True to our mission as a Catholic university, ACU Blacktown is distinctly Catholic

but welcoming of people of all faiths and none.
Saint Josephine is an inspiration to people everywhere and her prayers and example will help us
contribute to the mission and priorities of the Diocese of Parramatta, in which St Josephine Bakhita
Campus is located.

9. Glossary of Terms
1. Background Information
1.1 Australian Catholic University (ACU) is subject to the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 (Act).
The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 which commenced in March 2014
made significant changes to the Act. This Policy complies with the new requirements imposed by the
Act.
2. Policy Statement
2.1 ACU is committed to managing personal information in an open and transparent way. ACU is a
registered company and is subject to the requirements of the Act. It adheres to the Australian
Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.
3. Policy Purpose
3.1 This Policy sets out how ACU collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information including
sensitive information.
4. Application of Policy
4.1 Subject to clause 4.2, this Policy applies to all personal information and sensitive information
collected and held by ACU.
4.2 Despite clause 4.1 , any act done or practice engaged in by ACU directly related to:

a current or former employment relationship between ACU and an individual, and
a current or historical employee record held by ACU relating to an individual
are exempt from this Policy in accordance with the Act and the APPs.
4.3 Employee records are governed by the provisions of ACUâ€™s Employee Records Privacy
Policy.
5. Privacy Principles
5.1 Personal information collected and held by ACU
ACU collects personal information for the purposes of ACUâ€™s functions and activities. It collects
personal information about staff, students and other individuals who have dealings with ACU for
administrative need, to conduct its business, for legislative compliance or for research purposes.
The information may include residence and contact details, date of birth, details of next of kin,
identifying information, including photographs, records of injuries, criminal checks, student
enrolment information and academic performance, qualifications, financial information, information
concerning individuals who apply to the University for appointment or admission, and information
collected from or concerning human research subjects.
Some of the personal information that ACU collects and holds is sensitive information. ACU only
collects sensitive information where it is necessary for the purpose for which it is being collected and
with the individualâ€™s consent unless the collection is required or authorised by law.
5.2 How ACU collects and holds personal information
ACU collects and holds information from a number of sources. Where reasonably possible, ACU will
only collect information from the individual to whom it relates. Frequently this will be collected
through official University administrative processes but it may also be collected from email, letters or
other forms of communication.
ACU also holds personal information about individuals that it generates in the course of its
operational activities, such as recruitment information, student placement information, research
grant applications, academic feedback and examination results and library loan records.

Personal information is held in both paper and electronic form, including databases.
When an individual accesses the ACU website, log files (â€œcookiesâ€•) are created by the web
server that contain certain information including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the visitor, the
previous site visited, the time and date of access and pages visited and downloaded. Cookies allow
a website, such as the ACU website, to temporarily store information on an individualâ€™s machine
for later use. ACUâ€™s website uses cookies to identify unique visitors to the site.
In order to improve ACUâ€™s services and assist the user, ACU may store information about users
of its website to create a digital profile and provide them with information specific to them.
ACU also uses Web Analytics to obtain statistics about how its website is accessed. Web Analytics
relies upon cookies to gather information for the purpose of providing statistical reports to ACU. The
information generated by the cookie about an individualâ€™s use of the ACU website is transmitted
to and stored by Web Analytic service providers on servers located within and outside Australia, but
it does not include any personally identifying information.
Individual users generally have the option of accepting or rejecting cookies by adjusting the settings
in their web browsers. However, rejecting cookies may impact upon the functionality of the ACU
website.
The ACU website may contain links to other websites. ACU cannot control the privacy controls of
third party websites. Third party sites are not subject to ACUâ€™s Privacy Policy or Procedures.
5.3 Notification of collection of personal information
When ACU collects personal information it will advise the individual why it is collecting that
information and how it uses it, whether the collection of the information is required or authorised by
law and the consequences for the individual if the personal information is not collected. It will also
provide information about ACUâ€™s Privacy Policy and about the right of individuals to access and
correct personal information. If ACU collects personal information in circumstances where the
individual may not be aware of the collection it will seek to advise the individual of the collection.
5.4 The purposes for which ACU collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information

ACU collects and uses personal information for a variety of different purposes relating to its
functions and activities including:

purposes directly related to the above.
5.5 Use or disclosure for secondary purposes
ACU does not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than the purpose for which it
was collected (the primary purpose) unless:
5.5.1 the individual has consented to a secondary use or disclosure, or
5.5.2 the secondary use or disclosure is related to the primary purpose (in the case of personal
information that is not sensitive information) or is directly related to the primary purpose (in the case
of sensitive information), or
5.5.3 it is otherwise required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order,or
5.5.4 a permitted general situation exists (as described in clause 9 of this policy), or
5.5.5 ACU reasonably believes that it is necessary for one or more enforcement related activities
conducted by, or on behalf of,an enforcement body.
In ordinary circumstances, any disclosure of personal information for a secondary purpose under

scenarios 5.5.3, 5.5.4 and 5.5.5 must be approved by the Privacy Officer.
5.6 Security
ACU applies both physical and information and communications technology (ICT) security systems
to protect personal information.
In relation to electronic records, personal information is collected via ACUâ€™s systems including
web-based systems. ACU has put in place measures to protect against loss, misuse and alteration
of electronic information. Where necessary, ACU also uses encryption technology to protect certain
information and transactions.
5.7 Remaining anonymous or using a pseudonym
ACU understands that anonymity is an important aspect of privacy and that in some circumstances
some people may prefer to use a pseudonym when dealing with ACU. People have the right to
remain anonymous or to use a pseudonym when dealing with ACU. However for a significant
proportion of its activities (e.g. matters relating to enrolment, teaching and assessment of individual
students) it is impracticable for ACU to deal with individuals who have not identified themselves or
who have used a pseudonym.
5.8 Unsolicited personal information
When ACU receives unsolicited personal information it will assess whether it is personal information
that it could legally collect. If it is, it will treat it according to the APPs. If it is not, it will, if lawful to do
so, destroy or de-identify it as soon as practicable.
5.9 Direct marketing
ACU will only use personal information for direct marketing with the individualâ€™s consent or when
authorised by law.
5.10 Destruction of information that does not need to be retained
When ACU no longer needs to retain personal information, and is lawfully able to do so, it will
destroy or de-identify that information.
5.11 How an individual may access personal information about the individual that is held by ACU

Subject to clause 4.2, anyone has a right under the Act to access personal information that ACU
holds about them. Access to personal information is governed by the Access to and Correction of
Personal Information Procedure.
5.12 How an individual may seek the correction of personal information about the individual that is
held by ACU
Subject to clause 4.2, anyone has a right under the Act to request corrections to any personal
information that ACU holds about them if they think that the information is inaccurate, out of date,
incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. Correction of personal information is governed by the Access
Procedure.
5.13 How an individual may complain about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles by ACU
Subject to clause 4.2, anyone may complain about a breach of an APP by ACU. Complaints should
be made in accordance with the Privacy Inquiries and Complaints Procedure.
5.14 How ACU will deal with complaints about breaches of the Australian Privacy Principles
ACU will deal with complaints about breaches of the APPs in accordance with the Inquiries and
Complaints Procedure.
5.15 How ACU will manage an actual or suspected data breach under this policy
ACU will manage the process of dealing with an actual or suspected breach in accordance with the
Data Breach Procedure and Response Plan.
5.16 Disclosure of personal information to overseas recipients by ACU
ACU may disclose personal information to overseas recipients. For instance, ACU my disclose
personal information to an overseas university which requires proof of the academic standing of an
individual before it permits the individual to enrol or to facilitate staff or student exchange. ACU will
only do this at the request of, or with the specific approval of, the individual whose personal
information it is.
ACU will disclose personal information in these circumstances to an overseas recipient in any
country.

ACU may also disclose personal information to overseas recipients who are service providers for
research or purposes, including data storage. Australian law may not apply to those recipients. ACU
will ensure that appropriate data handling and security arrangements are in place. Disclosure of
personal information to overseas recipients may also be required or authorised by law.
5.17 Disclosure of personal information to third parties
ACU may disclose information to third parties to
provide services
for purposes of research to improve its operations and services
facilitate national surveys carried out in relation to the higher education sector
promote its activities
if permitted or required by law, or
otherwise with the consent of the individual.
Where ACU discloses personal information to third parties it will require restrictions on the collection
and use of personal information equivalent to those required of ACU by the Privacy Act 1988.
